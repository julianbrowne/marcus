again\\nand did you see the new polls from usa today came out\\nand every year they'd come in and they'd be looking for help\\nand every year they'd have to come and come\\nand frankly the ones that

how about the pain that they put justice kavanaugh through right\\nand how do you beat what we've done\\nand i came into office i did a lot of this\\nand i can't be happy with that because i love our country\\nand i know the senators and they're great guys and women too\\nand i know your previous governor was a republican but i was not a big fan of his\\nand i love doing it with everything that i

about finished\\nand i used a bad word\\nand i will never ever stop\\nand i won't tell you the story but very early on i thought we were going to have a problem someplace and one of the generals came up to me and said \\nand i'll tell you something it used to be they'd always say \\nand i'll tell you something rush limbaugh said it\\nand i'll tell you the other thing i don't know who the security company is but the police came up but they want to be so politically correct so they don't grab her wrist lightly and get her out\\nand i'll tell you we have a lot of new stars in the republican party i could read off a list of 20 names\\nand i'll tell you what i know some of the people in this audience\\nand i'm fighting for you\\nand if the press was fair this thing never would have happened\\nand if they do they say \\nand if we didn't have a good deal you know what i would have done what\\nand if we were democrats they would've been in jail two years ago\\nand if you don't do that they arrest the border patrol people\\nand if you look at that first period of a couple of months it was a disaster but it was heading south\\nand if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind like i do\\nand in all fairness he campaigned harder than crooked hillary because he had more strength\\nand in all fairness to bill clinton he used to be a friend of mine until i ran for office\\nand it is\\nand it is true\\nand it rains and it's filth and it's needles and it's drugs and it's you know what\\nand it's a very strong agreement so we can't get sued\\nand it's about keeping our industry not closing it because of the ridiculous paris climate accord\\nand it's longterm they're not going to have to come\\nand it's very exciting\\nand ladies and gentlemen of michigan the best is yet to come\\nand let me just tell you a little secret\\nand listen though it's so true it threatens to destroy what our founders pledged and in fact their very lives to build\\nand merry christmas michigan\\nand michigan is the state where generations of strong tough and proud american workers made this into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world\\nand nancy pelosi is playing games\\nand now i hear she wants to run again\\nand now we're getting these prosecutors that you murder somebody they give you two months they fight that you don't even have to go to jail\\nand now you have the democrats trying to take credit for this deal and that's okay\\nand our extraordinary jobs boom which created another 266000 jobs last month and then you add the undercount from the previous two months you're close to 300000 jobs\\nand she didn't come to michigan enough\\nand she didn't come to wisconsin i think at all right\\nand she had a lot of pressure especially from manufacturing areas farm areas a lot of pressure to sign it\\nand sleepy joe gives a sleepy answer and that's the end of it\\nand so what i did is you can have either one\\nand that was long before i ever decided to do this\\nand that was with no help from the democrats\\nand that's because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and they're coming in from japan and they're coming in from a lot of other places\\nand that's great that's what we wanted\\nand that's more money than anything we're talking about\\nand that's okay\\nand that's on top of the many other investments we've gotten from japanese companies car companies and other companies\\nand that's really what it is\\nand that's what it is\\nand that's what you want\\nand that's why it doesn't work\\nand the bottom line on the end of her story so when i won i said \\nand the other thing the cameras do you ever notice i go to these stadiums 25 30000 people\\nand the republicans have got it right\\nand the same with asians the best unemployment\\nand the word is that we're much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in 2016 in michigan\\nand then he finished with \\nand then he said \\nand then i became president\\nand then i said the attorney general of the united states i didn't say my campaign i said the attorney general of the united states i didn't say my campaign manager\\nand then i say \\nand then it actually says i think \\nand then nancy pelosi said i shouldn't use the term animal\\nand then she gives the guy the finger and he \\nand then the president said do me a favor\\nand then they say \\nand then we learned about lisa page and her wonderful lover peter strzok\\nand then what do i say\\nand these guys don't like talking about it\\nand these maniacs want to close it up\\nand these people back here\\nand they had some horrible crimes happening from those sanctuary cities\\nand they hate me\\nand they said \\nand they said if you're a business watcher which i am i love watching business but they said they were guessing could be 70000 could be 80000 maybe 90 maybe 110 somebody said\\nand they said this two years ago i said \\nand they say \\nand they were going to be out of business within two years\\nand they worked one job versus two or three jobs\\nand they've been trying to do it for 49 years\\nand this country the deals we made we did a deal with south korea\\nand together we are taking back our country\\nand union labor loves me and i love you too sir\\nand we also recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights\\nand we are making it bigger better and stronger than ever before by far\\nand we did it\\nand we had some really bad things with mexico\\nand we have agreements now with guatemala honduras el salvador\\nand we have tremendous support in the republican party like we've never had before\\nand we just approved and we're approving very soon for the governor of florida ron desantis where he can buy he has the right to go we're giving him the right to go and buy from a foreign country where the prices for the identical drug identical drug are 50% less\\nand we just made the usmca\\nand we live by the words of our national motto and it's always going to be up there\\nand we set records at everyone because we use the floor\\nand we won michigan\\nand we're going to do that for your governors if they want to do that\\nand we've moved out thousands and thousands of ms13 thugs out of our country\\nand what goes with a sink and a shower\\nand while democrats are obsessed with impeachment we're focused on jobs jobs jobs\\nand women i'm sorry 71 years best in 71 years\\nand yet i think the enthusiasm right now is greater than it was even before the 2016 election\\nand you know i don't know if you know this but probably 10 years ago i was honored\\nand you know i heard somebody say \\nand you know i won't tell you one of the things because every time i tell you they do a big number on it\\nand you know it's funny we're not even into election season\\nand you know that\\nand you know the incredible thing and i was with a lot of farmers\\nand you know the number one group of people that are going up is the blue collar worker\\nand you know they're considered hazardous waste\\nand you know those stories largely have been recanted\\nand you know what\\nand you know what\\nand you know what\\nand you know what happened\\nand you know what i like to do\\nand you know what they don't understand\\nand you know why\\nand you see that\\nand you think that was easy\\nany guy that does that they're no good\\nanybody in the front row\\nanybody that becomes president i mean they could have a phone call and they get impeached\\nanybody that becomes president of a country and that's a big country and it's a tough country you got to be tough\\nanything i asked him get schumer on the phone \\nanything to get rid of us\\nanytime he sees a camera and he's stone faced stone faced\\nanyway but they're spending money you know what can i tell you\\nanyway so what we're doing is we're doing things that are going to make our victory it's like a tree\\nanyway so you know what else\\nare we almost there\\nare we spoiled\\nare you the greatest guy\\nas you know you do have sanctuary cities in michigan\\nat stake in our present battle is the survival of the american nation\\nauto industry\\nauto industry forever\\navoid them\\nbased on that you know what\\nbeautiful\\nbecause he's a pro\\nbecause he's a pro\\nbecause her polling data looked good\\nbecause i understand she's not fixing those potholes\\nbecause i'll tell you the big problem\\nbecause if you remember when i ran i went immediately to number one never came off number one\\nbecause is there a better place to be in the world than a trump rally\\nbecause it's known for major corruption\\nbecause look at what we're accomplishing is unbelievable\\nbecause of the new light they're terrible\\nbecause people we have an election right down the road\\nbecause the enemy can't see it\\nbecause they have these maniacs that say you got to go all electric\\nbecause they raise gasoline prices so they could send them money all over the world to countries that the people in france never heard of\\nbecause they'll say \\nbecause we had such big deficits with these countries\\nbecause we have a lot of choices but i wanted to be here because this area supported me so overwhelmingly and i said \\nbecause we just provided record funding for a nation's historically black colleges and universities\\nbecause without good defense maybe we don't need judges so much right\\nbecause you have democrats that do not like our military\\nbecause you know he's a corrupt politician 100%\\nbefore i got there but that's what i used to talk about\\nbest year it's ever had\\nbig arenas\\nbig deal\\nboo\\nboo\\nboo\\nboy those reports are kept\\nbush they all did\\nbut all i want to say is let's put it this way it was the most profuse thank you that you could ever get on a scale of zero to 10 it was a 10\\nbut another thing we did which to me is such an incredible thing to have done\\nbut anyway i was the man of the year and probably close to 10 years ago and i came to michigan\\nbut congressional democrats are directly attacking 2\\nbut didn't you read it\\nbut every time i see a man get up i see a beautiful woman with a baby and they're getting up\\nbut he goes \\nbut he said \\nbut he said \\nbut he talked about wisconsin\\nbut he told you know the way they tried to shut him out right\\nbut here's the thing\\nbut here's the thing\\nbut how about giving iran $1\\nbut i also know we have a great group of people behind us in the republican party we really do\\nbut i gave him a+ not a not b+ not b\\nbut i know one thing americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote pelosi the hell out of office\\nbut i made a lot of great friends out of that group and many of them are good friends today\\nbut i mean thousands and thousands of people can't get into these nba arenas right\\nbut i never mention that because one time i mentioned all three i said \\nbut i said \\nbut i saw them pronouncing buttigieg and they said \\nbut i think within another couple of months you'll be historical\\nbut i wanted to be here\\nbut i'd rather be here frankly than any place\\nbut i'll never forget that night\\nbut i'll tell you what\\nbut i'm thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of christmas the greatness of america and the glory of god\\nbut ideally i want to fill them up\\nbut if she has the crowd \\nbut if you do it's there\\nbut in battle creek you don't have that many right\\nbut in the last two decades before my election we lost one in five auto manufacturing jobs in this country\\nbut it's all going to end soon and it's going to come out to a beautiful great victory for the republican party and for this nation\\nbut it's so disappointing\\nbut let me tell you\\nbut let's assume he's looking down\\nbut look how we're doing\\nbut michigan's had the best year it's ever had\\nbut nobody has ever asked us to do this\\nbut now they're getting really good and some of them are getting great and over a period of time they are going to be phenomenal\\nbut now think of what they did\\nbut once you're beyond the military i mean to me defense is the most important\\nbut one of the best things is firing james comey's ass out of there\\nbut seriously look look look they won't say it\\nbut she said \\nbut she's not fixing the potholes\\nbut so biden has this rally they've got 200 seats but only a small number of people\\nbut so what they're saying now is he was weak because the wording it just doesn't fit\\nbut the other thing the democrats always stick together\\nbut there's a poll we're beating everybody\\nbut there's no bias\\nbut these companies are coming in a lot of the foreign companies are coming because they have to\\nbut they always used to say\\nbut they are all of them they want to close up your energy\\nbut they are great people\\nbut they don't say it that way\\nbut they don't say that\\nbut they think the washington swamp should be able to veto the results of an election\\nbut they want to close them up and we're not closing them up\\nbut they'd been trying to impeach me from day one\\nbut they're all coming in and a lot of them are coming to michigan\\nbut they're giving up their honor and they'll receive a big backlash at the box office\\nbut think of this african-american unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in the history of our country\\nbut this guy schiff \\nbut this sacred season our country is thriving and it's thriving truly like it has never it has never happened before to the extent what's happening now\\nbut we had 18 people and i was center stage\\nbut we had this is about a 5500 seat arena\\nbut we have a great usmca that we negotiated with mexico with canada\\nbut we have to go through a little pain because we have to do it and then they all say \\nbut we use the floor right\\nbut we're getting it fixed\\nbut we're joined tonight by many terrific republican leaders\\nbut what happens what happens is we have wall street journal the other day got the best story\\nbut what they put that man through was horrible what they put his family through was horrible\\nbut what they've done with this perversion it's perversion\\nbut what we're doing has been an incredible thing\\nbut whatever it is and you'll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb\\nbut while we're creating jobs fighting for michigan workers and achieving numbers that you've never seen before incredible victories for the american people are happening\\nbut with the light bulb i said \\nbut you know he lied on that\\nbut you know the way we're not going to have to use them is if we have them\\nbut you know what\\nbut you know what\\nbut you know what\\nbut you know what\\nbut you know what i also see\\nbut you know what it is because it's all gas\\nbut you know what they have done\\nbut you remember he was against the bible he was against religion he was against guns and he was against oil and gas\\nbuttigieg\\nbuttigieg\\nby proceeding with your invalid impeachment you're violating your oath of office\\nby the way by the time they press it 10 times you spend more on water and electric\\nby the way by the way by the way it doesn't really feel like we're being

say \\nand i'm only here because of him and joe\\nand i'm saying this for you and i'm saying it for all of you\\nand i'm standing in the lincoln bedroom\\nand i'm the one that signed it\\nand i'm up at the incredible suite level and there's abraham lincoln's suite\\nand i've only won one election but it's for the president of the united states\\nand it comes under it's like a corkscrew right at the bottom of the plane\\nand it goes into effect on january 1st\\nand it opens up and if it's raining or windy you're covered sir because it's under the plane\\nand it saved the industry\\nand it says 10 years\\nand it's complex\\nand it's happening with so many other things\\nand it's like an unlimited amount\\nand it's my honor\\nand it's the same thing as joe\\nand jefferson and lincoln\\nand larry cuffe is here\\nand mark meadows did a great job\\nand michelle has my complete and total endorsement\\nand new york people are going to do it\\nand nobody has showed up in four months to take down a statue\\nand nothing happens to her\\nand now with the phones i think there's like 22 or 24 people\\nand now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for minnesota\\nand on november 4th the press will probably say let's say something stupid happened\\nand one of those things i was very early and i banned and everybody admits that had i not banned highly infected wuhan province right\\nand our guys better get on the ball\\nand our numbers on the border are the best they've ever been\\nand pulitzer association the committee should ask for those prizes back\\nand remember this and i really appreciate this thank you\\nand remember this is a big much bigger than the old 747\\nand robert e\\nand saturday night nobody showed up\\nand she controls nancy pelosi\\nand she was the one that brought it up\\nand so they all said \\nand some schmuck back there said \\nand speaking of north korea and you know it's okay to have really\\nand thank heavens for ice and thank heavens for border patrol because these people do a job that you don't want\\nand that wall is going up think of that\\nand that was because his general was killed who's going to lead gettysburg\\nand that's okay\\nand that's what happened that night the night of the election\\nand that's where these guys begin\\nand that's why the supreme court is so important\\nand the judges which we've done at a level like nobody's ever done everything we've done\\nand the next day they said \\nand the old act said if you rip down a monument or a statue you get 10 years in prison\\nand the only one i could think of is ted because he's going to get 50 republican votes and he's going to get 50 democrat votes\\nand the other clown will be in office\\nand the traffickers and drugs are way down\\nand then boeing came to me and i love to negotiate\\nand then he said \\nand then he was going to be able to negotiate\\nand then i did it and just week after week one out two out three out four out\\nand then i get to the most beautiful house in the world\\nand then i go up and make one speech and i call them concast and that's the end of the pr for the year\\nand then i spoke to the head of boeing a very nice guy\\nand then people automatically vote\\nand then she goes around and calls us all like what the hell are we\\nand then she hit her phones with a hammer\\nand then somebody says \\nand then the fake news\\nand then they say \\nand then they vote for a democrat\\nand then we're supposed to protect germany from russia\\nand then we've done changes\\nand then what happened\\nand then you can probably add another four to that\\nand then you had the chart\\nand then you take guys so many so many\\nand these arab countries would have their beautiful 747 800s 900s pour in and they were gorgeous\\nand they are available\\nand they don't even know\\nand they had the most beautiful trump flags\\nand they have my complete endorsement\\nand they only call the election immediately if you win in a landslide it's got to be tremendous\\nand they said \\nand they said it about ohio too\\nand they said it four years ago \\nand they should return the pulitzer prize\\nand they spend a fortune\\nand they took away the incentive and puerto rico went down a long way\\nand they took these guys out and they were fairly tough\\nand they went crazy\\nand they were marching on washington\\nand they were so proud\\nand they'll say what a job he's doing this president\\nand they're all going to do it\\nand they're doing a good job over there\\nand they're going to be happy as hell jason\\nand this guy is going to win texas by a hell of a lot of votes\\nand thousands of people that couldn't get in and i'm working my ass off\\nand together we are taking back our country\\nand together with the incredible people of minnesota and you know what's going to be operating at strength\\nand we brought nasa back\\nand we caught them spying on my campaign\\nand we did price transparency\\nand we get along\\nand we had a big texas rancher\\nand we had an attorney general that didn't have a clue\\nand we saved the industry because i got russia and saudi arabia to cut back 10 million barrels\\nand we will end our reliance on china once and for all\\nand we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in god we trust\\nand we will make america great again\\nand we're catching them\\nand we're doing great\\nand we're going to have a better year coming up\\nand we're the number one in history in regulation cuts which is the biggest thing\\nand when they try it a guy like biden that can't carry his jockstrap\\nand wisconsin rarely\\nand yet he's running for the presidency\\nand yet you're still paying very low gasoline prices at the pump but we saved 10 million jobs\\nand you know he's got a lot of people that are deep staters whatever you want to call them\\nand you know i have an instinct about things pretty much\\nand you know if i was wrong they would but they can't question me because when you see right to try we took care of our vets\\nand you know it's a funny thing\\nand you know it's starting today in minnesota\\nand you know why i did it\\nand you probably heard me today\\nand you're going to get so tired you're going to say \\nand you're going to keep winning and winning and winning\\nand you're going to send jason to the us senate\\nand you've taken three years of total investigation\\nandrea zupancich where is she\\naoc aoc is running a campaign against the guy that was supposed to be speaker of the house\\naoc gets rid of $2000 000\\nare you campaigning against this maniac\\naren't you supposed to get licensed\\nat least a good president\\nat least you know one thing\\nbe careful\\nbecause by the time i got there it was just scheduled\\nbecause he can't draw a crowd\\nbecause he didn't think we had a problem\\nbecause i owe it to these incredible mayors that were so nice to me\\nbecause i wanted to make sure that i had somebody on a list we had about 45 unbelievable people unbelievable\\nbecause i went to mobile alabama\\nbecause if you don't get it right we will not have a country anymore\\nbecause it's the same thing\\nbecause this is a protest\\nbecause you know why\\nbecause you've heard the other one\\nbeen to washington i guess 17 times i never stayed over\\nbelieve me\\nbeto o'rourke who's in charge of guns\\nbetween a governor and a mayor the crime is through the roof the corruption is incredible it's a sad thing that's happened to new york\\nbiden\\nbiden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban to jihadist regions jihadist regions\\nbiden has promised a 700% increase in the manifesto with bernie right\\nbiden will overwhelm your children's schools overcrowd their classrooms and inundate your hospitals\\nbig difference between four years ago and now\\nbig state great state\\nbill barr\\nboy are you good\\nboy we almost had it last time\\nbring that sucker up immediately to the oval office because there are a lot of people coming to washington\\nbut after four or five times asking i'm a loyal person and i did it\\nbut ali velshi i don't know anything about the guy but i know he was standing there\\nbut allowed her to get away with that is a disgrace\\nbut at some point you got to buy a plane for the country\\nbut beto o'rourke he did the story and he was going to defeat ted cruz\\nbut between her and how about aoc\\nbut boy did you get your money's worth tonight\\nbut communists are a hell of a lot worse and that's where we'd be headed\\nbut forget about that\\nbut he does have enthusiasm to beat trump\\nbut he is he's a high quality guy\\nbut he was a great general\\nbut he was against the ban\\nbut he's a sharp as you can be\\nbut he's getting tougher and tougher\\nbut he's going to be fantastic\\nbut he's sort of grandfathering it\\nbut he's the one that two months later called me xenophobic and he called me a racist because i was banning china which was heavily infected\\nbut historically that never wins\\nbut home it's so sad what the democrats have done to our great new york\\nbut i actually do on the other side\\nbut i appreciate this because nine democrat mayors of cities in the iron range have endorsed me over sleepy joe\\nbut i don't believe it\\nbut i even said \\nbut i get off the plane and they said \\nbut i had one\\nbut i hope you appreciate that we had a period of time when they were ripping down all of the statues and monuments\\nbut i said \\nbut i said it was incredible\\nbut i say this\\nbut i think it's better if i stay uninvolved\\nbut i won wisconsin\\nbut i'll tell you a little story\\nbut i'll tell you the white house is still the white house no matter how you do it\\nbut i'll tell you what's changed is the fact that we have more enthusiasm now than we did four years ago\\nbut i'm in texas and let me tell you texas appreciated it because that industry was in deep trouble because all of a sudden with the pandemic there was no demand\\nbut i'm thrilled to be here with the beautiful great hardworking people of this incredible state\\nbut if biden wins china wins and it's very simple\\nbut if we're up to biden your state would be in ruins\\nbut if you look they don't want me to win\\nbut if you vote for me i'm the difference and i'm the wall\\nbut isn't that sort of a good thing\\nbut it allows me to say whatever i want about this guy\\nbut it just shows when you have leaders when you have a great general\\nbut it was too late\\nbut it worked for him\\nbut it's my fault\\nbut it's not\\nbut it's terrible\\nbut it's the most sophisticated two planes\\nbut jason you're in good shape wow\\nbut joe he's off the scale\\nbut joe's energy is far lower\\nbut just to get back to the others\\nbut maybe i'll come over to see mike\\nbut no administration obama bush they didn't want to do it because it sounds luxury\\nbut no it's true\\nbut no way he gets worse\\nbut one thing i learned is that president xi of china is sharp\\nbut please remember i did this too\\nbut remember barbara streisand used to stay in that suite\\nbut robert e\\nbut robert e\\nbut robert e\\nbut russia got that information from the obama administration\\nbut said \\nbut seriously take a look at the aoc\\nbut she deletes her emails\\nbut she gets a subpoena from congress\\nbut she used to stay there\\nbut so they had four or five lines\\nbut somebody has to go in and clean it up\\nbut thanks michelle\\nbut that didn't work out\\nbut that was it\\nbut that's all you do\\nbut that's the way it is\\nbut that's what it is\\nbut the great thing about those beautiful planes they have more televisions than any plane in history\\nbut the next one we'll have anywhere from one to four\\nbut the one thing i said is we want trump\\nbut the police were much tougher\\nbut these guys all got it right\\nbut these guys are better looking than tom\\nbut these guys keep saying it's in play\\nbut these people they're anarchists and the only thing they understand is strength\\nbut these stupid people that run they get $40000000 a year and they're weak\\nbut they all had one thing in common\\nbut they all made the exact same mistake\\nbut they did it and we've done a great job and the people of that great state they understand it and i just hope the people of your state of minnesota understand it because we don't have too many more chances with this stuff\\nbut they didn't want to do it that way\\nbut they don't know quite what we have but they know we have stuff that they never even heard of before\\nbut they get two\\nbut they got the prize right\\nbut they said texas is in play\\nbut they say we had a smattering of people\\nbut they should give the pulitzer prize to the people that got it right and they should withdraw from all of those writers many of whom are back there right now all of those writers they should do that\\nbut they tried to me-too him\\nbut they work\\nbut they're cable so i guess there's a different standard\\nbut we are making a lot of progress if you see what's going on\\nbut we can buy a stairwell for the plane\\nbut we did the right thing\\nbut we don't really need him because this is the greatest single assemblage of talent ever assembled for one party\\nbut we had no cell phones in that day right\\nbut we have an idea what they're ripping down\\nbut we have done some job with that\\nbut we have now one that's much faster than that\\nbut we have the most powerful weapons ever conceived by man\\nbut we told and found this old act\\nbut we'll hire more police increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities which are a disaster\\nbut we're getting down to all of it\\nbut we're riding down the beautiful pennsylvania avenue\\nbut were talking about that\\nbut what am i going to tell you\\nbut when you look at it when you look at it our country is amazing\\nbut when you're flying these planes you can land that sucker you have no problem\\nbut when you're using the public airwaves free\\nbut why don't we just call it a protest\\nbut you have a lot of groups of people just like this every place we go\\nbut you know she had no money nothing\\nbut you know you wouldn't do it because he couldn't do it\\nbut you remember it was going to be a nuclear war and i got along with him\\nbut you saw the head of the fbi yesterday started going russia\\nbut you think about it and he said \\nbut you're getting used to winning and you're going to see winning like you've never seen before\\nbut you're going to win\\nbut you're not allowed to do that\\nby contrast i rescued the minnesota iron range i did that\\nby the way are they still trying to get rid of your police force in minneapolis\\nby the way did you see the anderson cooper thing last night\\nby the way he's going to take your guns away\\nby the way these pilots are the best pilots\\nby the way this

situation and he's become a real leader and that's republican leader kevin mccarthy\\nbut all of that is changed\\nbut he knew it all the time devin nunez\\nbut how good a coach in all fairness here is coach belichick\\nbut i can say this 2020 is essentially just as important because they'll try and take it away\\nbut i can tell you they'd like to get back to business because they're not doing very well\\nbut i knew it was going to happen because we go out and we see these rallies the likes of which no one has ever seen before ever ever ever in politics ever in politics\\nbut i was willing to do it i would've taken it\\nbut in my first week in office i proudly withdrew from that job destroying tpp catastrophe and we're replacing one of the worst trade deals ever made by any country\\nbut it's a rough job and they get so little praise for the job that they do\\nbut it's never been so far left\\nbut nobody's ever asked us to do that before\\nbut now you finally have a president who understands that i'm not supposed to be the president of the world i'm supposed to be the president of the united states of america\\nbut one of the biggest issues in this election is in fact sanctuary cities\\nbut our country could fix it so easy if the democrats would sit with me for 15 minutes but they don't want to do that because they want to have open borders\\nbut the radical democrats want to dismantle demolish and destroy everything that you've gained and they will do it and it won't take that long\\nbut they can do it\\nbut they said that if the bulb break it's considered almost like the waste site\\nbut thom tillis has really worked with us over the last period of time\\nbut to pass the bill we need more republicans\\nbut we actually have the world cup it's the biggest sporting event in the world and we got it\\nbut we are going to achieve new breakthroughs in science medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending within 10 years the aids epidemic in america\\nbut we don't fight anymore\\nbut we had a different location as you all know and we said \\nbut we had a phrase make what\\nbut we had to rebuild our military was totally depleted it was totally depleted\\nbut we won one of the greatest elections in history and because of that and you would be in big trouble if we didn't i can tell you that\\nbut you know somebody told me that as you know they're much more expensive bulbs than for what you save\\nbut you know we've created six million new jobs since election day and i couldn't say that in my initial rallies because nobody would have believed it\\nbut you know what\\nbut you know what their answer is\\nby the way i have about 10 women in the front row and you come from north carolina and they travel all over the place\\ncan you believe it\\ncan you imagine\\nchina has taken advantage of our country for decades decades\\nchina made $500 billion over the last number of years on a yearly basis they steal our

transcribed\\namerica is thriving like never before\\namerica is winning again like never before\\nand all i did was buy some stock\\nand as i always say and i've already said it twice tonight this country is so respected and we were not respected four years ago we were laughed at\\nand as i said african american hispanic american asian american unemployment the lowest ever in the history of our country the lowest unemployment rates\\nand by the way he his foreign minister everybody did you know they said \\nand by the way the senate's been so professional so good so strong so solid\\nand by the way the whistleblower the whistleblower defrauded our country because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue and we broke up the game\\nand by the way we build the greatest weapons the greatest planes the greatest ships we build it in the united states there's nobody that comes close\\nand by the way you know they talk about the elite\\nand do you people out there i'm sorry it's pretty rough\\nand don't forget look at the floor and then you go out\\nand everything's built right here in the united states\\nand guatemala honduras and el salvador we signed a very important agreement with each\\nand he was quickly replaced by his second-in-command and his second-in-command is now dead\\nand hello pennsylvania\\nand henry j\\nand i got it approved so you can sign a document get it\\nand i hate to tell you this when i was campaigning three and a half years ago i'd come here you weren't doing so well folks\\nand i have to say this look and i always have to say this you have some really great journalists and you have some honest publications but not too many of them i have to be honest with you\\nand i know his grandfather i shouldn't say that to you\\nand i love pennsylvania\\nand i'm thrilled to report that we are on the verge of ending the nafta catastrophe once and for all\\nand in 2020 i'm going to work like hell that we take over the house\\nand it was you know to me impeachment is a very ugly word\\nand it wouldn't be much different in the state of pennsylvania that i can tell you\\nand just a few weeks ago the united states special forces brought the world's number one terrorist to justice\\nand now after and a half years now that the russia witch hunt is dead a big fat disgusting fraud the congressional democrats are pushing the impeachment witch hunt having to do with ukraine but that's already failing\\nand now more importantly than anything wages are up for the first time in many many years decades decades\\nand proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country\\nand remember this al-baghdadi was the founder of isis al-baghdadi was a vicious ruthless person al-baghdadi created a caliphate bigger than the state of ohio\\nand right here in pennsylvania we've created 160 000 brand new beautiful jobs and you have companies moving in and moving back\\nand right now we're by far the largest economy in the world\\nand she knew what would happen\\nand some of these partisan lunatics have already said that if they fail this time think of this\\nand that means jobs that means 401ks\\nand that's one of the very big reasons why our i think that and regulations but that's one of the very big reasons why our economy is doing so well because they talk about our consumer is loaded with money\\nand that's the only way they can do it\\nand that's what's been happening for the last two and a half years\\nand the fbi also sent multiple undercover human spies to surveil and record people associated with our campaign\\nand the first thing they almost always say \\nand the reason they announced it on the same day one hour later they announce impeachment a few guys standing behind her\\nand then the informer who is the informer\\nand then they announce there was no bias\\nand then when you add energy savings and you add tax savings you have almost a $10000 gain in three years\\nand then you wonder why we have so many people trying to come through at the borders\\nand there's no other word\\nand they advertise \\nand they come right from the state of pennsylvania\\nand they didn't know what we were talking about but they said \\nand they will\\nand think of it this way also the silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt that's the reason they approved usmca\\nand this report was great by the ig especially since he was appointed by president barack hussein obama\\nand today we set a new record almost 160 million people are working\\nand two people that you all know very well in this state they bring home the bacon dan meuser and fred keller\\nand u\\nand we call them up and we said \\nand we had the biggest crowds\\nand we have other things we're going to do that are incredible\\nand we have our new phrase because we've made america great\\nand we have regulation and you need some regulation but you don't need regulation that doesn't allow you to build a simple road or highway\\nand we live by the words of our national motto \\nand we now have taken 100% of the caliphate and we have thousands and thousands of isis prisoners\\nand we're doing well with the deal but they want to make a deal\\nand we've got our eye on and our sights on third also we know exactly where and when but it's becoming a very unpopular job not a lot of takers and that's what we want\\nand while it was tough on my family i have to say very unfair to my family very tough on my family\\nand yet he saying \\nand you don't have your doctor\\nand you know he's never leaving don't you\\nanyway here in pennsylvania you had the single best year that you've ever had in the history of our country not bad\\naoc plus three\\nare you better off now than you were four years ago\\nas we speak a criminal illegal alien with three prior deportations is roaming free in pennsylvania because he was released by the city of philadelphia the city of brotherly love\\nat first i thought he was kidding\\nbecause over the last three years you see the stock market set 131 records from the day\\nbecause people now can not only make a lot more money if they don't like their job they go out and they get a different job and they get more money and ultimately they find one that they love\\nbecause republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god\\nbecause they want to win an election\\nbecause they're fake\\nbecause together we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america proud again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again\\nbecause we've let them know the price is very bad if they don't do that\\nbelieve me if i weren't a good developer you could forget about that wall\\nbeto beto\\nbribery and this and that\\nbut any democrat that votes for this sham will be voting to sacrifice their house majority their dignity and their career\\nbut beyond defense they always say the most important thing you can do is judges and justices of the supreme court\\nbut but i have to tell you as bad as it is it meant something\\nbut conan the dog got more than i did and that's okay\\nbut day after day we're exposing something called that filthy disgusting horrible swamp and we're cleaning it up\\nbut far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities demonstrating their sneering contempt scorned and disdained for everyday americans\\nbut he didn't want to say that\\nbut he doesn't want to say it\\nbut he said he's not ever going to become president and strzok look back \\nbut honestly it's an incredible deal for our country\\nbut i have so many people 401ks are through the roof your jobs are through the roof we have the lowest unemployment rate\\nbut i'm not going too far with any of these people because i thought i was way too early with elizabeth warren\\nbut it screwed up the whole works because most guys would never do that\\nbut it's like when you plant a tree it needs time to grab on\\nbut just quickly here are the facts on shifty schiff\\nbut no there's never been anything like it\\nbut now we're stronger politically than we were ever before\\nbut she's going back down again\\nbut that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion\\nbut the impeachment hoax is about overturning your great 2016 vote or in the alternative trying to win the 2020 election\\nbut the voters of this commonwealth will never ever let that happen\\nbut the whistleblower is gone\\nbut the word impeachment to me is a very very ugly word\\nbut then she opened that fresh mouth of hers and it stopped\\nbut these are only the cases we know about\\nbut they all say \\nbut they all say that\\nbut they always say \\nbut they said they'll do it again because this has been a total bust\\nbut they're all looking at the same thing\\nbut this has never happened\\nbut today the house democrats announced these two flimsy pathetic ridiculous articles of impeachment\\nbut together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration\\nbut unlike those politicians i keep my promises\\nbut we do a great job\\nbut we're building it and it's fine and we have the money coming in from the military\\nbut we've all done the great job\\nbut we've also created 7 million new jobs since the election\\nbut we've done a good job in many ways\\nbut what we've done for our vets what we've done in rebuilding our military what we've done in so many ways and we unlike the democrats will protect your second amendment\\nbut while we're delivering historic victories for the american people the radical left democrats and the failed washington establishment are trying to erase your votes nullify the election and overthrow our democracy\\nbut with the help of everyone here we have now the hottest economy\\nbut you know somebody that believes in that is sleepy joe biden\\nbuttigieg\\nby the way russia wishes that hillary clinton won\\nby the way to this day there has never been and they'll always correct me in the history of politics in the history of our country there has never been anybody that drew crowds like we draw and i don't have a guitar\\nby the way was that the most exciting night ever\\nby the way

was really great\\nbiden pledged to reinstate it\\nbiden spent the last 47 years betraying the american people\\nbiden supported cutting social security\\nbiden went there today\\nbiden will never be able to protect your jobs or your family\\nbiden would wipe out that entire industry killing the jobs of more than 600000 pennsylvania workers\\nbiden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorist\\nbringing a lot of things back home\\nburger king\\nbut again you had the greatest year you've ever had last year prior to the virus\\nbut biden replied yes he'll get rid of those jobs\\nbut did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him\\nbut everything he said is right because he has no control over what's happening\\nbut follow that ballot because these people they'll be lost they'll be gone the numbers are incredible where they're 25 and 30% off 20% off\\nbut for the entire summer biden was silent as far left rioters viciously attacked law enforcement in democrat run cities all burned down businesses terrorized civilians and just recently marched through the streets chanting \\nbut he did say i wasn't perfect but that's okay\\nbut he led his men on a daring mission across the delaware\\nbut he was on the cover of the magazine\\nbut how about this one\\nbut i do these polls\\nbut i go in i come out a couple of hours later i guess whatever it is it's a short time later i get into the car the press sees me get into the car\\nbut i said \\nbut i took out an old ordinance\\nbut i will keep your jobs in america and i'll bring rioters looters violent extremists anarchists we will bring them to justice\\nbut i will tell you the election that we have coming up is the single most important election in the history of this country\\nbut i'll tell you this man is something special\\nbut if it's not true my wife was like she came to me she said \\nbut if we have a close election that means nevada has the right to and i love nevada i think we're going to win nevada except where they're sending all these hundreds of thousands millions of unsolicited ballots to people in nevada and people that probably left a long time ago\\nbut if what's going on in the rest of the country is like what's going on in tennessee\\nbut if you look at it the things they've done we're going to go through a couple of different polls as we go along because i love the people saying do this or do that\\nbut if you remember last time i go in i spend a little time a physical like we all have\\nbut in certain ways i like this better\\nbut it is true\\nbut it's okay for them to make every city look just like portland which is a disaster\\nbut nothing happened\\nbut now it's going to go down very big because we did a favorite nation's clause\\nbut one of the things i got you out of is this thing sounds so good but it's so bad\\nbut she made them open and the salon turned her in and the salon did business with her\\nbut she said \\nbut take a look at what he says about guns and he got put in charge of guns\\nbut take a look at what they say about the way they handled the swine flu\\nbut the anesthesia\\nbut the problem these shutdowns are causing much bigger problems\\nbut the rioters that want biden to win they want him to win because their agenda it's what they want\\nbut the stock market's at record levels\\nbut there's what i think they're doing because you have the same thing in new york\\nbut they fought me on this price transparency\\nbut they knew i'm in the motorcade and yet they reported it anyway because they fake news\\nbut they protected it\\nbut they still go with it they go with it\\nbut they're all voting for me\\nbut they're right behind me\\nbut think of it\\nbut this commonwealth it's a great commonwealth\\nbut this conor lamb was out there fighting it and he shouldn't have done that\\nbut unfortunately he's a former because he's just i don't know\\nbut we could end it in portland\\nbut we did a great job it was an amazing thing\\nbut we had record enthusiasm in 2016\\nbut we had some time\\nbut we will make america wealthy\\nbut you always have to say well wait a minute\\nbut you can't this whole thing with the unsolicited unsolicited means you're sitting there\\nbut you go down the highways and you see it and i was thinking of texas i'm making a speech in front of obviously people that like oil they like god and you know what else they like they like their second amendment right\\nbut you have to make sure your vote counts because the only way they're going to beat us is by doing that kind of stuff\\nbut you're great rick and you did a fantastic job\\nby the time you get finished the straw is totally disintegrated\\nby the way as far as the capital of israel jerusalem they've been talking

we were nominated a second time for another nobel prize\\nand then you read these fake reporters and they say \\nand there's no reason for that\\nand there's nobody that loves our military respects it and the people more than me\\nand these are statistics that come from people that do this stuff right\\nand they all said \\nand they are the only people that i will pick\\nand they had

complain\\nand then they fly to china and i'm dealing with people right now\\nand there is nothing that makes me happier than making that decision to run and win and straighten out the mess that these people have created\\nand there's no plan like those plans\\nand these guys don't even question it\\nand they could be so good for our country\\nand they destroyed their lives\\nand they did\\nand they killed me for that\\nand they knew that my election would finally end their pillaging and looting of our country\\nand they said \\nand they see sights that you and i hopefully will never see\\nand they told me everything and then we built some alternative walls\\nand they understand that\\nand they want to erase your future\\nand they would've given me all the financing i wanted for the wall\\nand they're always saying the same thing\\nand this is a serious wall\\nand to protect our industrial backbone i placed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel\\nand today i got a call from one of the top representatives he said \\nand trump does it without a guitar\\nand we called them i called them myself in many cases i said \\nand we had receptivity that was unbelievable\\nand we have 25000 people that we still love outside\\nand we have a particular colonel that's all he does\\nand we have no choice\\nand we have to promise them no more than 16 years\\nand we live by the words of our great national motto in god we trust\\nand we will only fight to win\\nand we won\\nand we won\\nand we won very quickly\\nand we work hard with the christians\\nand we're living through the insurance policy\\nand we're rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before\\nand we're thrilled to be joined tonight by some incredible people that have helped me so much\\nand we've set every record at every place virtually that we've gone\\nand what do they want to do\\nand what happened\\nand what happens is this big incredible machine flies in this tremendous cargo plane and it flies in so powerful so big\\nand you go over maria bartiromo and the great lou dobbs\\nand you know hispanic they understand borders better than anybody better than we do\\nand you know what\\nand you know what\\nand you know what\\nand your father was never considered smart\\nanybody like that\\nanyway good luck jason\\nas our brilliant white house counsel wrote to the democrats yesterday he said \\nas you know for many years leaders in washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers\\nat 269\\nbecause i want it\\nbecause i was told by these fraudsters back here in the media that trump cannot get to 270\\nbecause like strzok with his insurance deal this was before remember this this was before that statement was made months before i took office\\nbecause they never thought in a million years that i was going to release a transcript of the call\\nbecause they took it away from him\\nbecause we're dealing with some very sick and deranged people\\nbecause what are you going to do against president xi and kim jong un\\nbest iron ore there is anywhere\\nblackmail\\nbob come up\\nboy that's a lot of media\\nbrad parscale\\nbring our troops back home\\nbut a woman who would call me constantly\\nbut from now on we want to fight where it is to the benefit of the united states of america not to the benefit of other countries\\nbut he said \\nbut he's totally owned and totally controlled by the washington swamp for many years\\nbut here's the thing\\nbut honestly all evenings are electric\\nbut honestly the truth is with time i love you guys whether you're cops police officers law enforcement\\nbut i didn't get to 306\\nbut i enjoy it\\nbut i have to sign these letters\\nbut i kept going\\nbut i lose billions\\nbut i make as president about $450000\\nbut i said \\nbut i saw these young men and i gave them their purple hearts\\nbut i see this guy and i don't know if he's done a lot of television before but he was very effective and very good\\nbut i send these letters out quite a few\\nbut i think it'll go down and i hope it's going to go down as one of the greatest evenings in the history of this country because it's never happened anything like that before\\nbut i've been rough on them\\nbut if you refuse to bow or bend to the washington swamp which i could do very easily i'd be much more popular\\nbut in the trump administration we will always protect american families first and that has not been done in minnesota\\nbut instead of saying \\nbut it's like the way they change those tires takes four seconds to change the whole damn thing\\nbut my father would say \\nbut remember they've been fighting each other for hundreds of years and we were artificially put there in this case by president obama\\nbut she keeps going anyway because the press is fake and they play right into their hands\\nbut that was an amazing evening\\nbut the job he did before the election i came right here to minnesota and i pledged to address this really important issue and it's the issue of law enforcement\\nbut there's a time and there's not necessarily a time\\nbut these are great great people\\nbut these doctors at walter reed and these army and marine and the medical doctors they are unbelievably great people\\nbut they said \\nbut they smear you they spy on you and they target your friends your family your staff for harassment for abuse for destruction\\nbut they want to make it\\nbut they weren't allowed to do the job for us and they went wild\\nbut they will fail because in america the people rule again\\nbut they're fighting\\nbut they're our boy and they're our girl and it doesn't matter how old we get and how old they get is that a correct statement\\nbut they've been very nice\\nbut we got it for the right price\\nbut we won the point\\nbut we're ripping them all up and redoing them and they're going to be very good\\nbut when we say something about the united states you just don't say america with any intensity\\nbut you know what\\nbut you've got to hear jay z the words he was using he was using the f word all over the place and then the next day they say i use bad language\\nby the way whatever happened to hunter\\nby the way when you run if you're running the electoral college is like the 100 yard dash and the total vote you don't go certain places\\ncall me donald\\ncall me donald please\\ncan you believe it\\ncan you believe we're here three

beto\\nbiden\\nbiden also opposed my plan to ban europe i saw what was happening in france and spain and italy and highly infected we banned europe\\nbiden didn't agree he didn't they just told him what's happening\\nbiden has called to end cash bail you know that right for vicious criminals\\nbiden has vowed to remove those tariffs and allow china to resume its pillaging\\nbiden opposes school choice and vowed to ban charter schools\\nbiden opposes the death penalty for cop killers or mass murderers\\nbiden pledged to abolish american oil american jail clean coal natural gas\\nbiden says he wants to protect black lives but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of african american citizens\\nbiden was willing to sacrifice american lives on the altar of open borders\\nbiden will hand the left wing mob the keys to your kids' classroom\\nbiden's supported every disasterous global sellout for half a century including a nafta china\\nbrought back our manufacturing jobs rebuilt the awesome power of the u\\nbryan steil; young handsome but a warrior\\nburn down the buildings\\nbut all of them everybody\\nbut bernie is right on that subject that other countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off on trade\\nbut biden would absolutely eradicate your state's economy\\nbut biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists\\nbut by comparison to other countries and by almost all metrics we've done an incredible job including the job of helping the world with ventilators and all of the things that we built\\nbut by that time it was too late because they had already embarrassed themselves by doing it\\nbut he can't do it\\nbut he was taking a legend's place so it's never easy to replace a legend\\nbut he's a good man\\nbut he's in charge of the second amendment\\nbut i couldn't do that because i know how crooked she is\\nbut i especially want to thank a football legend he was great\\nbut i know a lot of very successful people very very successful\\nbut i predict the sanders people are going to vote for us like they did the last time\\nbut i put it and think of this by the end of the term we'll have approximately 300 brand new great federal judges court of appeals judges 300 which is a record 300\\nbut i said that if they close they close\\nbut i saw some farmers and this was like the straw that broke the camel's back\\nbut i want to congratulate the big 10 conference on yesterday's announcement that the fall season will start very soon\\nbut i want to just say they do disinformation they make up a phony story and then they go with it\\nbut if you have a family that you love and you have a small business or farm or whatever they were being put out of business\\nbut if you think that biden opposed the mission to take out of osama bin laden he was against it\\nbut if you want to really see a great job take new york and some of these other democrat run states out of it\\nbut if you're a president and you get nominated then two days later you get nominated did you know this a second time for a different deal\\nbut it did and we saved a lot of lives\\nbut it was all because of specialty milk and the way you were taken advantage of by canada\\nbut kamala harris and 13 members of biden's staff urged their supporters to donate to a fund to bail out rioters take them out of jail get them out of jail as soon as possible\\nbut last week they had the largest order of corn\\nbut last week they know how i feel and they're very smart\\nbut let me tell you they are very tough\\nbut many times world champion\\nbut my people didn't buy that because my people went out to vote\\nbut no we have enough politics\\nbut over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world\\nbut people don't want to see it and the ratings are down\\nbut remember everybody said i was going to be in war\\nbut remember that every night you'd have these horror stories about the va\\nbut remember this in politics it's always the thing that they say first that's what they're going to do\\nbut right now i will tell you iran if we win iran will be calling us within the first week they're dying to make a deal\\nbut that night remember they started off by saying \\nbut the anti police demonstrators they cheered and cheered when they saw this\\nbut the rhetoric of biden and the radical left puts your law enforcement in serious danger\\nbut the soldier story about standing over their graves you know the one i'm talking about then they do a commercial\\nbut then they took an ad saying i'm the one i didn't want it\\nbut there's tremendous pressure on your second amendment\\nbut these are players that have a shot at the nfl\\nbut they don't want to play that too often\\nbut this guy probably or possibly beat her\\nbut this was the final straw\\nbut unlike joe who lets you down when he'd never even came back to milwaukee to apologize or just to pay respects i came to wisconsin and i've been here a lot since since we started this a lot\\nbut walls are never obsolete neither are wheels\\nbut we actually catch them take their name release them say \\nbut we called them and the reason is that they took an ad\\nbut we can't let that happen\\nbut we did a great job in kenosha\\nbut we got it for wisconsin remember that\\nbut we have built and created weapons the likes of which this world has never seen before\\nbut we have three vaccines right now they're in the final stage clinical trials\\nbut we want to get that we want to take care of it\\nbut you know what\\nbut you know what\\nbut you take a few of the states out and you'll really see numbers\\nbuy american\\nby far i would say but she picked him and hopefully that's going to be history it's not going to matter and that is no way for a woman to become the first president that's for sure\\nby the way i was endorsed by new york's finest and we're with them all the way\\nby the way if we had two people die they would have said he did a terrible job\\nby the way that will destroy your country you do know that\\ncan you believe it\\ncan you imagine\\ncarolyn maloney\\ncheck it out maybe you can do something\\nchina never paid us 25 cents not 25 cents with obama and biden\\nclimb over each other's face you can climb right over their face\\ncome back in 1000 years from now\\ncome

world you wouldn't have problems\\nbecause it's a little hard and i'm all for mask when you need them i'm up but when you're making a speech and the nearest person's like where you are and you're in a stage all by yourself and then he had a habit of taking it off and it hangs down on his ear as he's speaking it makes him feel comfortable\\nbecause that's a lot of the territory that we

sound like italy\\nbut do you remember that beautiful day\\nbut get out and vote early\\nbut had she been loyal she would've left\\nbut he always wanted to run for president and he tried before i

don't let you do your job most importantly\\nbut i do wish they would show because it would be you know it's actually better for them if they show\\nbut i know we're going to win so it's not going to matter\\nbut i obliterated the isis caliphate which was all over the place\\nbut i said to my people i said so if they don't believe me what i'll do is i'll make up a list of 25 judges or people and

of justice but we're getting down to the bottom of it because it's not fair to us\\nbut if i just did that a sixth branch of the us military that would be a big deal\\nbut if you can spend think of

they said \\nbut stupidly i said \\nbut the fact is they wouldn't have written it anyway\\nbut they are paying for it mexico's paying for the wall\\nbut they never liked doing that you know\\nbut they never want to show the crowds\\nbut they're professionals they're anarchists\\nbut trump raised substantially less money than crooked hillary clinton\\nbut we caught him cold we got so much

made\\nand if you don't do that everybody gets sued\\nand if you remember three years ago when i took over we were depleted\\nand it's already having a big impact\\nand it's we it's we\\nand just in case you didn't know it ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state\\nand ladies and gentlemen of ohio the best is yet to come\\nand last week the united states once again took the bold and decisive action to save american lives and deliver american justice\\nand nobody's done it like we've done it\\nand now look the numbers i just gave you\\nand now the guys are here\\nand now they're starting to say \\nand on all your street do you see the difference now between what it is now\\nand one of our leaders one of our really admired people said \\nand our trade

demolished\\nand the man who is in charge of my campaign in ohio i had a choice of five people\\nand these are people that never voted\\nand they get scorned and we take out thousands and thousands of ms-13 members every single year\\nand they got there immediately fortunately\\nand they make the tanks\\nand they run in and they're swinging and punching\\nand they said \\nand they want to call them a safe place\\nand they were able to apprehend this terrible criminal\\nand they've been good\\nand this year's going to be even better and maybe much better\\nand very well we have the greatest labs

community\\nand we've already built over a 100 miles of wall\\nand we've authorized 441 new striker fighting combat vehicles and 453 new abrams tanks to be built in the buckeye state\\nand when you see our friends and our great wounded warriors and our great warriors when you see them without their legs and without arms and with so much damage it's most likely that he caused that damage because that's what he liked\\nand with the great help of a lot of incredible republicans and we had some democrats help us we passed right to try and you have to see how this works\\nand yet now i see the radical left democrats have expressed outrage over the termination of this horrible terrorist\\nand you can have a country that goes to hell very very fast very very fast\\nand you could've never gotten those workers\\nand you know instead they should be outraged by soleimani's savage crimes and the fact that his countless victims were denied justice for so long\\nand you know the drug companies didn't like it because they didn't want to take people that sick because they didn't want it on their charts\\nand you know what happened\\nand you know what i'm talking about\\nand you saw this was the anti-benghazi\\nanybody that says that i said \\nanything more fun than a trump rally\\nas a result of our actions steel mills all across ohio you know this better than i do are roaring back to life\\nas just one example right here in ohio you all know about it an illegal alien went on a deadly crime spree attempting to rape a 14-year-old girl\\nas long as we know that's all that matters\\nas the leader of iran's terrorist quds force soleimani spread death destruction and mayhem across the middle east and far beyond\\nbased on my instinct i said \\nbecause all of these things that we've done can be undone\\nbecause china devalued their currency and then they put a lot of money into the pot\\nbecause it's more painful than using a gun\\nbecause our country is doing so well\\nbecause they don't like raising their taxes and sending the money to faraway places that they'd never heard of\\nbecause together we will make american wealthy again\\nbecause we said \\nbecause you know you keep hearing you cannot win unless you win the great state of ohio\\nbefore they wouldn't take them back\\nbernie bernie has gone up\\nbernie sanders crazy bernie has condemned the us military strike on soleimani the world's top terrorist think of it the world's top terrorist and we're having people like nancy pelosi that's a real genius do you believe that one\\nbilly

pelosi we have them all they're all trying to say \\nbut i can't make it now because i'm trying to impeach trump i'm trying to impeach even though he did nothing wrong\\nbut i didn't talk about right to try\\nbut i have to now say do i want to change the greatest theme in political history make america great again with keep america great right\\nbut i never talked about did you ever hear me prior to the election talk about space force\\nbut i will tell you i haven't heard one thing where that was true\\nbut i'm thrilled to hold the first rally of 2020 right here in the great state of ohio\\nbut i'm tired of talking about this 10 months before the election\\nbut ice offices worked through ohio police to remove one thousand two hundred dangerous criminal aliens from your streets\\nbut it's true\\nbut just think of it\\nbut now they take them back\\nbut our strong action paid off and we'll sign that terrific and fully enforceable phase one trade deal with china\\nbut the democrats are taking their cues from socialist bernie sanders and that group\\nbut they turn all these arsonists out including killing their victims with machetes ms-13\\nbut they're losing and we're winning and america's comeback continues full speed ahead\\nbut this is what happened\\nbut under my administration we will never make excuses for america's enemies we will never hesitate in defending american lives and we will never stop working to defeat radical islamic terrorism never\\nbut we stopped him we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold\\nbut we were able to get

we win america wins\\nbecause the fact is we don't have to be in the middle east other than we want to protect israel\\nbecause the only way they can win is by doing very bad things\\nbecause they have rules in these democrat run states that if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people\\nbecause this is important we win north carolina we win\\nbecause this is not like a second place crowd\\nbecause we've really implemented things\\nbiden also cheered the rise of china as a positive development positive development for america and for the world\\nbiden got the nomination\\nbiden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left you know that with crazy bernie and everyone\\nbiden has pledged to end production

places are democrat run places radical left run places\\nbut do you remember last time too\\nbut he was better against bernie\\nbut i said \\nbut i said that was going to happen\\nbut i would say walls and wheels have a great future\\nbut if biden would have sat back and if elizabeth warren pocahontas you remember pocahontas\\nbut if she would have dropped out on super tuesday prior to super tuesday bernie would have been the nominee\\nbut if sleepy joe biden takes power the economy will collapse\\nbut if this guy doesn't open up your state because almost all of them are open now if he doesn't open up your state you have no choice you're going to vote for him anyway but dan you'll be so good\\nbut if you come back in a thousand years there are two things with all the computers and

all we did much better\\nbut other than that we don't have to be in the middle east\\nbut she said \\nbut the best way of not having to use them is to have them\\nbut the biden-harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we're close to putting it out getting it out and we're going to get it out fast\\nbut the big deal is he's changed\\nbut the big difference is she's smarter than he is\\nbut the dc committee did you see about that\\nbut the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they're united by their contempt for the american middle class in the truest sense\\nbut the other is a basic disaster for our country\\nbut they make up stories horrible stories many many\\nbut they picked somebody from california\\nbut they say it's very much different\\nbut they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the united states economy again\\nbut they're like this\\nbut we did it once we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event a terrible event a horrible event\\nbut what obama did and biden did with that horrible iran deal\\nbut you go to jail for 10 years\\nbut you just take a look at what's going on in north carolina\\nbut you know what\\nbut young people are very strong against this horrible disease\\nby contrast my administration is following the science protecting those at
