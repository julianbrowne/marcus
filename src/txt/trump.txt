a criminal alien with two previous deportations was just arrested in michigan and convicted of brutally beating and strangling to death a single mother of five young children
a lot
a lot of it has to do with the phony witch hunt because you're smart people
a lot of people are complaining about the cost
a lot of people don't know that but i do
a lot of people forget that but we have to bring it up
a lot of people here now have healthcare finally under us that's phenomenal
a lot of these countries france they like obama
above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america
abraham lincoln can't win in texas with that platform
african american
after about two weeks they killed him
after three years of sinister witch hunts hoaxes scams tonight the house democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic americans
again
ah he knows
ainsley said it but a lot of people have said it
alfred e
all my life we never did well with the 401ks with stocks
all of a sudden they said 
all of them they said 
all of those countries
all they did was take away your companies and let them go to mexico and other places
alright
america is thriving like never before
and a lot of people don't know of the electric can ever catch the gas you know
and after years of rebuilding foreign nations we are finally rebuilding our nation
and all your washington folks they are right where they have to be in washington tonight
and as sure as you're standing and i'm sorry we couldn't get you seats we didn't have any room
and by the way 20000 people outside had to leave
and by the way cnn and msnbc their ratings are down the tubes
and by the way i spoke to the unions the day before i say 
and by the way she ought to go home and take care of her district where the homeless is all over the place and the tents and the filth and the garbage is a eroding right into the pacific ocean and into their beaches
and by the way there'll be different forms of energy coming along
and by the way this is for a hundred years
and by the way your state because of us not because of local government but because of us because of the job that we've done
and did you notice that everybody is saying merry christmas again
and did you see the new polls from usa today came out
and every year they'd come in and they'd be looking for help
and every year they'd have to come and come
and frankly the ones that didn't recant i don't know what a supreme court judge does but he should sue them
and frankly you know what it is
and general motors recently announced a $300 million investment at its orion assembly plant right here in michigan
and generally they did it because we were way ahead from the beginning
and he comes from texas
and he said 
and history has proven that stops them
and how about the pain that they put justice kavanaugh through right
and how do you beat what we've done
and i came into office i did a lot of this
and i can't be happy with that because i love our country
and i know the senators and they're great guys and women too
and i know your previous governor was a republican but i was not a big fan of his
and i love doing it with everything that i have
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i said to japan 
and i said to my people 
and i said two things
and i say 
and i say 
and i say 
and i thought i was just about finished
and i used a bad word
and i will never ever stop
and i won't tell you the story but very early on i thought we were going to have a problem someplace and one of the generals came up to me and said 
and i'll tell you something it used to be they'd always say 
and i'll tell you something rush limbaugh said it
and i'll tell you the other thing i don't know who the security company is but the police came up but they want to be so politically correct so they don't grab her wrist lightly and get her out
and i'll tell you we have a lot of new stars in the republican party i could read off a list of 20 names
and i'll tell you what i know some of the people in this audience
and i'm fighting for you
and if the press was fair this thing never would have happened
and if they do they say 
and if we didn't have a good deal you know what i would have done what
and if we were democrats they would've been in jail two years ago
and if you don't do that they arrest the border patrol people
and if you look at that first period of a couple of months it was a disaster but it was heading south
and if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind like i do
and in all fairness he campaigned harder than crooked hillary because he had more strength
and in all fairness to bill clinton he used to be a friend of mine until i ran for office
and it is
and it is true
and it rains and it's filth and it's needles and it's drugs and it's you know what
and it's a very strong agreement so we can't get sued
and it's about keeping our industry not closing it because of the ridiculous paris climate accord
and it's longterm they're not going to have to come
and it's very exciting
and ladies and gentlemen of michigan the best is yet to come
and let me just tell you a little secret
and listen though it's so true it threatens to destroy what our founders pledged and in fact their very lives to build
and merry christmas michigan
and michigan is the state where generations of strong tough and proud american workers made this into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world
and nancy pelosi is playing games
and now i hear she wants to run again
and now we're getting these prosecutors that you murder somebody they give you two months they fight that you don't even have to go to jail
and now you have the democrats trying to take credit for this deal and that's okay
and our extraordinary jobs boom which created another 266000 jobs last month and then you add the undercount from the previous two months you're close to 300000 jobs
and she didn't come to michigan enough
and she didn't come to wisconsin i think at all right
and she had a lot of pressure especially from manufacturing areas farm areas a lot of pressure to sign it
and sleepy joe gives a sleepy answer and that's the end of it
and so what i did is you can have either one
and that was long before i ever decided to do this
and that was with no help from the democrats
and that's because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and they're coming in from japan and they're coming in from a lot of other places
and that's great that's what we wanted
and that's more money than anything we're talking about
and that's okay
and that's on top of the many other investments we've gotten from japanese companies car companies and other companies
and that's really what it is
and that's what it is
and that's what you want
and that's why it doesn't work
and the bottom line on the end of her story so when i won i said 
and the other thing the cameras do you ever notice i go to these stadiums 25 30000 people
and the republicans have got it right
and the same with asians the best unemployment
and the word is that we're much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in 2016 in michigan
and then he finished with 
and then he said 
and then i became president
and then i said the attorney general of the united states i didn't say my campaign i said the attorney general of the united states i didn't say my campaign manager
and then i say 
and then it actually says i think 
and then nancy pelosi said i shouldn't use the term animal
and then she gives the guy the finger and he 
and then the president said do me a favor
and then they say 
and then we learned about lisa page and her wonderful lover peter strzok
and then what do i say
and these guys don't like talking about it
and these maniacs want to close it up
and these people back here
and they had some horrible crimes happening from those sanctuary cities
and they hate me
and they said 
and they said if you're a business watcher which i am i love watching business but they said they were guessing could be 70000 could be 80000 maybe 90 maybe 110 somebody said
and they said this two years ago i said 
and they say 
and they were going to be out of business within two years
and they worked one job versus two or three jobs
and they've been trying to do it for 49 years
and this country the deals we made we did a deal with south korea
and together we are taking back our country
and union labor loves me and i love you too sir
and we also recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
and we are making it bigger better and stronger than ever before by far
and we did it
and we had some really bad things with mexico
and we have agreements now with guatemala honduras el salvador
and we have tremendous support in the republican party like we've never had before
and we just approved and we're approving very soon for the governor of florida ron desantis where he can buy he has the right to go we're giving him the right to go and buy from a foreign country where the prices for the identical drug identical drug are 50% less
and we just made the usmca
and we live by the words of our national motto and it's always going to be up there
and we set records at everyone because we use the floor
and we won michigan
and we're going to do that for your governors if they want to do that
and we've moved out thousands and thousands of ms13 thugs out of our country
and what goes with a sink and a shower
and while democrats are obsessed with impeachment we're focused on jobs jobs jobs
and women i'm sorry 71 years best in 71 years
and yet i think the enthusiasm right now is greater than it was even before the 2016 election
and you know i don't know if you know this but probably 10 years ago i was honored
and you know i heard somebody say 
and you know i won't tell you one of the things because every time i tell you they do a big number on it
and you know it's funny we're not even into election season
and you know that
and you know the incredible thing and i was with a lot of farmers
and you know the number one group of people that are going up is the blue collar worker
and you know they're considered hazardous waste
and you know those stories largely have been recanted
and you know what
and you know what
and you know what
and you know what happened
and you know what i like to do
and you know what they don't understand
and you know why
and you see that
and you think that was easy
any guy that does that they're no good
anybody in the front row
anybody that becomes president i mean they could have a phone call and they get impeached
anybody that becomes president of a country and that's a big country and it's a tough country you got to be tough
anything i asked him get schumer on the phone 
anything to get rid of us
anytime he sees a camera and he's stone faced stone faced
anyway but they're spending money you know what can i tell you
anyway so what we're doing is we're doing things that are going to make our victory it's like a tree
anyway so you know what else
are we almost there
are we spoiled
are you the greatest guy
as you know you do have sanctuary cities in michigan
at stake in our present battle is the survival of the american nation
auto industry
auto industry forever
avoid them
based on that you know what
beautiful
because he's a pro
because he's a pro
because her polling data looked good
because i understand she's not fixing those potholes
because i'll tell you the big problem
because if you remember when i ran i went immediately to number one never came off number one
because is there a better place to be in the world than a trump rally
because it's known for major corruption
because look at what we're accomplishing is unbelievable
because of the new light they're terrible
because people we have an election right down the road
because the enemy can't see it
because they have these maniacs that say you got to go all electric
because they raise gasoline prices so they could send them money all over the world to countries that the people in france never heard of
because they'll say 
because we had such big deficits with these countries
because we have a lot of choices but i wanted to be here because this area supported me so overwhelmingly and i said 
because we just provided record funding for a nation's historically black colleges and universities
because without good defense maybe we don't need judges so much right
because you have democrats that do not like our military
because you know he's a corrupt politician 100%
before i got there but that's what i used to talk about
best year it's ever had
big arenas
big deal
boo
boo
boo
boy those reports are kept
bush they all did
but all i want to say is let's put it this way it was the most profuse thank you that you could ever get on a scale of zero to 10 it was a 10
but another thing we did which to me is such an incredible thing to have done
but anyway i was the man of the year and probably close to 10 years ago and i came to michigan
but congressional democrats are directly attacking 2
but didn't you read it
but every time i see a man get up i see a beautiful woman with a baby and they're getting up
but he goes 
but he said 
but he said 
but he talked about wisconsin
but he told you know the way they tried to shut him out right
but here's the thing
but here's the thing
but how about giving iran $1
but i also know we have a great group of people behind us in the republican party we really do
but i gave him a+ not a not b+ not b
but i know one thing americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote pelosi the hell out of office
but i made a lot of great friends out of that group and many of them are good friends today
but i mean thousands and thousands of people can't get into these nba arenas right
but i never mention that because one time i mentioned all three i said 
but i said 
but i saw them pronouncing buttigieg and they said 
but i think within another couple of months you'll be historical
but i wanted to be here
but i'd rather be here frankly than any place
but i'll never forget that night
but i'll tell you what
but i'm thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of christmas the greatness of america and the glory of god
but ideally i want to fill them up
but if she has the crowd 
but if you do it's there
but in battle creek you don't have that many right
but in the last two decades before my election we lost one in five auto manufacturing jobs in this country
but it's all going to end soon and it's going to come out to a beautiful great victory for the republican party and for this nation
but it's so disappointing
but let me tell you
but let's assume he's looking down
but look how we're doing
but michigan's had the best year it's ever had
but nobody has ever asked us to do this
but now they're getting really good and some of them are getting great and over a period of time they are going to be phenomenal
but now think of what they did
but once you're beyond the military i mean to me defense is the most important
but one of the best things is firing james comey's ass out of there
but seriously look look look they won't say it
but she said 
but she's not fixing the potholes
but so biden has this rally they've got 200 seats but only a small number of people
but so what they're saying now is he was weak because the wording it just doesn't fit
but the other thing the democrats always stick together
but there's a poll we're beating everybody
but there's no bias
but these companies are coming in a lot of the foreign companies are coming because they have to
but they always used to say
but they are all of them they want to close up your energy
but they are great people
but they don't say it that way
but they don't say that
but they think the washington swamp should be able to veto the results of an election
but they want to close them up and we're not closing them up
but they'd been trying to impeach me from day one
but they're all coming in and a lot of them are coming to michigan
but they're giving up their honor and they'll receive a big backlash at the box office
but think of this african-american unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in the history of our country
but this guy schiff 
but this sacred season our country is thriving and it's thriving truly like it has never it has never happened before to the extent what's happening now
but we had 18 people and i was center stage
but we had this is about a 5500 seat arena
but we have a great usmca that we negotiated with mexico with canada
but we have to go through a little pain because we have to do it and then they all say 
but we use the floor right
but we're getting it fixed
but we're joined tonight by many terrific republican leaders
but what happens what happens is we have wall street journal the other day got the best story
but what they put that man through was horrible what they put his family through was horrible
but what they've done with this perversion it's perversion
but what we're doing has been an incredible thing
but whatever it is and you'll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb
but while we're creating jobs fighting for michigan workers and achieving numbers that you've never seen before incredible victories for the american people are happening
but with the light bulb i said 
but you know he lied on that
but you know the way we're not going to have to use them is if we have them
but you know what
but you know what
but you know what
but you know what
but you know what i also see
but you know what it is because it's all gas
but you know what they have done
but you remember he was against the bible he was against religion he was against guns and he was against oil and gas
buttigieg
buttigieg
by proceeding with your invalid impeachment you're violating your oath of office
by the way by the time they press it 10 times you spend more on water and electric
by the way by the way by the way it doesn't really feel like we're being impeached
by the way do you know what
by the way i ended the iran nuclear deal
by the way though that evening that incredible evening in november one of the biggest nights in the history of television
by the way you ever see this guy

i mean you got this guy schiff
i never stopped you
i never thought this could
i never want to hear a president
i noticed people are using that word
i pass compactor plants
i promised we've done more than we promised
i raise my hand to impeach
i recognize israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
i remember when i first started this beautiful trip this beautiful journey i just said to the first lady 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said i was going to bring car companies back
i said i'm going to bring car back
i said it to all my people
i said now we give them $5 we give them nothing
i said shinzo he's great prime minister of japan
i said that is the most aggressive human being i've ever met
i said that's a platform
i said to him my people i got there because they say the most important thing you could do as a president is judges and supreme court
i said when i was honored that night i said 
i saw her on a television show and george stephanopoulos that's another beauty he said even he said he was defending me
i saw some houses where they had four of them on one lawn and two of them on the car
i say 
i say 
i say 
i say 
i say 
i say 
i say 
i say defense is the most the military is the most
i say it against the fake news because you know what they're going to say
i say it out loud because i say it to them right now
i say mankind and womankind
i says 
i see a woman carolyn maloney
i see him at so many rallies
i tell you the story all the time
i then sent him the transcript
i think a lot of it has to do with a witch hunt
i think it's 100
i think it's almost worse than what they write and you can't get much worse than what they write
i think it's fantastic
i think it's terrible
i think one of the best things i did as president a lot of people would say 
i think we should impeach him for that
i think you could handle yourself
i thought i knocked off pocahontas
i took the trip to wisconsin and i'll tell you what they had those trump/pence signs all the way to the convention area every lawn every loan
i took you on this fantastic journey
i turn them all down
i understand that
i understand that but it's my life very unfair to my family
i used to be a big contributor to him he used to kiss my ass chuck schumer
i vote to impeach trump
i want odd numbers because of your center stage if you have a 10 that means two people are in the middle
i want them in this country
i want to be there
i want to have an alternative a big alternative
i was almost surprised to hear it but you have them
i was happy
i was in michigan and i'm telling you they had those damn signs
i was made for this job to run for president
i was not but i'm not a big fan of the one that can't fix the potholes either
i was the man of the year by i think somebody whoever
i was the man of the year in michigan
i was totally exonerated
i was with a group of 36 farmers at the white house
i was with her
i wasn't happy about that
i watch these guys come in like biden he has a big rally and they get 93 people show up
i watched adam schiff
i went through the whole muller hoax
i went to a last great state and i said 
i went to better schools
i went to nato where we were being ripped off because the other countries you have 29 countries and the other countries weren't paying their bills
i will consider it a personal front if you allow him to be president
i will say i could have a much easier life
i withdrew from the horrible trans pacific partnership
i won't go into the conversation because it's not fair do that
i won't say who answered because you know i'm not i actually used to like the guy he was a nice guy to me but now i don't like him so much but that's okay
i won't tell you what took place in those closed door meetings
i wonder what he has
i would have put tariffs on both countries and that would have been it right
i would like to apologize
i would like to apologize
i'd like to thank everybody for being here
i'd love him to win
i'll give you a couple of quick numbers
i'll give you a little clue
i'll say 
i'll tell you these people are crazy
i'll tell you what
i'm asking you
i'm going to be pres it was all like it's good
i'm going to bring this
i'm hearing very good thing
i'm killing everybody
i'm not going to say bad things about him
i'm not just talking about this little point in time
i'm not worried because it's always good when you don't do anything wrong you get impeached
i'm sorry folks
i'm surprised
i'm telling you i have a group of african american guys and gals by the way that follow me around and they think i pay them and i don't
i'm telling you if you look it's like 15 years just down
i'm telling you they're as bad as china just smaller
i'm the first person that ever get impeached and there's no crime
i'm very proud of it right to try
i've been using it for the last year
i've had crowds over the last couple of weeks
i've had you up to here mayor pete
i've let the women down
i've never loved anyone like you
i've never seen that before
i've never seen that before
i've told this story but i've had many so many times but this guy in particular because it was early and that was a year ago
if crooked hillary would've won your economy would have crashed
if i ever become more popular that means i'm not doing my job
if i spent not $45 million not 18 trump haters i call them the angry democrats
if i'm up there if i'm down here i don't know but we'll be fighting
if one of us did that it would be like the biggest story ever
if somebody wants to break a deal with me you always have to have an alternative right
if that were me it's the electric chair
if the economy's any good
if they ever wanted to break the deal that's okay
if they helped because you need their votes if they helped i could get those drug prices down 40 and 50%
if this man and that beautiful woman happened to get up because they want to go to the bathroom those cameras will turn to those two seats and they'll say 
if we didn't have them and i told you before they're taking out bad bad bad people by the thousands especially ms13 gang members
if we had a murderer then we should get them the hell out
if we're attacked and aren't doing very well and somebody says ‘well at least we have a good budget' that doesn't work too well
if you have a good economy
if you want to buy the newer kind you can
if you want to end sanctuary cities in michigan if you want to protect your families from criminal aliens if you want to have a safe life frankly it's so crazy what they're doing
if you want your children to grow up a land of safety it's really we want a land of safety justice
if you wear one of those suckers you got to give it up fast because within two weeks they got you
if you're a democrat they say 
immigration i had a lot of them but that may be the single biggest
impeach him
impeachment light
in 10 years it's a 10 year process we will have ended the aids epidemic in america and it could have been been started before i came to office
in a period of two and a half years we have eliminated more regulations than any other president by far
in all fairness
in france president obama is more popular than president trump
in june two illegal aliens in sandusky michigan were convicted of sadistically beating and stabbing a woman to death with a kitchen knife
in less than three years you had more than $10000
in new york where i come from we have a lot of unions
in the history of our country this group is doing the best and that group is doing the best and the women are doing the best and everybody's doing
in the meantime they close all their factories here
is she okay
is that okay
is that right
isn't he
isn't he peter
it causes problems with the wife but we won't talk about that
it gave us motown the mustang and the might of the american midwest
it hurt the people
it is not supported by fact
it is supported by fact
it is unprecedented what we're accomplishing
it looked good to me too
it makes it very very prohibitive
it produced 250000 jobs for south korea
it was 13 then it went to 18 and then mueller
it was all about roads and they want to raise those gasoline taxes on you
it was based on illegality
it was crashing
it was depleted
it was in bad shape
it was just a little piece of a deal
it was just upheld
it was just wasted time
it was one o'clock in the morning
it was the last speech of michigan
it's a big deal
it's a big deal the fisa court
it's a big pile of stuff that's a million
it's a disgrace
it's a disgrace
it's a disgrace
it's a great deal
it's a great deal
it's a great thing to have deficits
it's a long time
it's about clean air and it's about clean beautiful water
it's actually called super stealth
it's all right we're going to give you a subsidy of the same and we're going to take it out of the tariffs and we're going to have billions and billions of dollars left over
it's an incredible thing
it's been going on a long time
it's big stuff and we're doing it with a lot of other things our dishwashers
it's brutal what they do
it's called artificial barriers or non-monetary barriers
it's called the loophole
it's cheapened it
it's coming
it's coming
it's crazy
it's crazy
it's down to a much smaller number but we're finding new cures for childhood cancer and we are ending the aids epidemic in america
it's embarrassing
it's everything and it goes right into those storm sewers
it's exactly what our founding fathers didn't want and they said it could happen and it's happened
it's fine
it's funny we have these companies come in
it's going to stop exactly what we were just talking about
it's great
it's happening all the time
it's impeachment light
it's incredible
it's incredible
it's like a real estate trend
it's like somebody said 
it's much more expensive four or five times more
it's no good for me
it's not working out too well
it's okay
it's one of the reasons our economy is doing well because as they say the consumer is doing better than they've ever done
it's one of those progressive things
it's over
it's percentage the best
it's so cold outside we told them 
it's so much fun
it's sort of amazing
it's such an honor
it's terrible
it's terrible
it's the economy stupid
it's the nicest thing that's ever happened
it's the place where general motors chrysler and kellogg transformed the nation
it's those quiet type that get you
it's true
it's true
it's true they write fake polls
it's unheard of
it's unprecedented
it's us
it's wonderful to have them back
john would be so thrilled
just don't talk about it
just in case she loses we have an insurance policy
just remember it come november
laura ingram said it
lee come up if you want
let her pay me back all the money
let her pay me back all the money
let it go
let me tell you something
let me tell you you cost this country billions and billions and billions of dollars in all of the things that didn't get done in all of the embarrassment to our country
let us just have it
let's always pretend you're one point down
let's impeach him for that for the irs scandal for the guns
like last time
like the one in korea that was a hillary clinton special
listen they were worried they're going to hurt people
lock her up
lock her up
lock her up
long time
look at gas prices
look at what i've done for steel
look great job
look look look and the place
look we could do it where we do it every year or we'll do what we have
look what's happening
look you got to make this deal or we're going to put a 20% tariff on the cars
loyal citizens like you help build this country
ma'am would you
make it 11 or make it nine or i'm not showing up
making another group of tariffs seven and a half percent
manufacturing jobs won't happen
many big planes going over to iran loaded up to the ceiling with cash
many of you went to better schools
many people saw it
maybe he just calls her crooked
maybe he's looking up
maybe i wouldn't feel the same way but we have a great group of people behind us
maybe maybe

nobody else could do that i guarantee
nobody ever asked for money
nobody ever leaves our speeches

nobody what is you know
nobody's ever had this kind of support
nobody's ever seen before
nope it's going to be close
not because of me
not in this group
not me
not me of course not me but you him
not me us
not that easy
not the best but think of this $45 million they spent
not to good
not too many stadiums
now from the standpoint of the farmers you know what's going on
now i say basically very simple do us a favor our country
now i sit back and i watch and let's see what happens right
now i've been doing this for a long time and i have much bigger crowds than anybody's ever had in history
now it's going up beautifully and we want that the salaries
now it's like 
now multiply it $1
now that's why i was a little surprised
now these are tough people right
now they talk about this phony impeachment and she's out there 
now they won't say that the fake news they won't say it
now think of it three democrats went over to our side no republicans
now we always correct him but i use the word us
now we don't want to even talk about it
now we're going to win it by so much you better remember all those
now what happens
now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of michigan
now you press it 12 times the women tell me 
now you're back

okay thank you very much
okay that's enough of that
okay that's what a couple of hundred miles away
one of the greats
one of them the other day they finally changed the word
or if you're poor you go home and you die
other countries come to see me all of their leaders and they say 
our country
our first duty and our one true allegiance is to you the american people before anybody else
our military by the way in all due respect to the previous two administrations our military was depleted
our president is an employee of russia
out of the big check we gave the farmers 16 billion dollars and 12 billion for the previous year
over a phony deal
over a phony deal i hate to tell you
over the last and the secretary general stoltenberg over the last period of just two years i raised not from us nothing from us $130 billion but that's nothing and over a short period of time they will be paying $530 billion more
pelosi makes it up and she backs him up
people forgot there was one that they never talk about it but that's okay
people were traveling they're terminally ill they're traveling all over the world
please go home
president obama would go there make a speech 
pretty good right
pretty simple
pretty simple pretty simple
read the transcript
really
released an illegal alien charged with assault with intent to murder after he repeatedly and viciously stabbed a man in the head with a broken bottle
remember about four months ago when we had one little period right
remember i used to say you remember look at you
remember obama
remember obama said 
remember the dishwasher you'd press it boom there'd be like an explosion five minutes later you open it up the steam pours out the dishes
remember the guns he was giving them to anybody that wanted them
remember the magic wand
remember the statement by president obama
remember they were all saying 
remember this what did i do
remember tpp
remember what he said i said 
remember when they all said remember when they all said 
republican party chairwoman ronna mcdaniel who i spoke to
republicans will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions and we will protect your preexisting physicians
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right now it's much higher than that
ronna no more
ronna she was so horrible
s
s
same with hispanic americans the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers
san francisco was the most beautiful city
sanctuary cities they love sanctuary cities
say 
say it's the most important thing
saying merry christmas
sayonara
schiff makes up so many things
sean hannity said it
see i don't agree
see that space force
she calls me up
she didn't listen fortunately
she had 500 people
she kept calling and said 
she loves everything
she ought to get back and take care of her district instead of wasting time on this nonsense
she ought to go and take care of her district in san
she ought to go home and take care of the homeless and take care of the filth and everything
she said 
she said 
she said ‘darling i think you're one of the greatest investors
she so in love
she thinks i'm a financial genius
she wants to go to sleep
she was always so nice 
she went out and they paid for a fake dossier
she'll get hell when she gets back home with mom
she's a congresswoman from manhattan the east side
she's a long time nothing much believe me
she's a no
she's gasping
she's gasping for air
she's in manhattan
she's so in love with me
should we get him up
showers
since the election we've created 41000 brand new motor vehicle and parts jobs manufacturing jobs
sinks right
sinks showers all of this stuff i did a lot of it
sinks showers and toilets
sir 
sir congratulations on your economy
sir could you come to michigan tonight
sir don't go
sir i want to thank you
sir it's great
sir should we leave and be there
sir we don't want money
sir we'd like to buy a nuclear submarine
so among the very first acts that i did was to stop the deal that would have dealt a death blow to the u
so anyway i made we had these big crowds
so as of yesterday we've had 133 record days in the stock market now and that's in less than three years
so beto when he first got in remember this clown
so for two eight-years you had a 400 450 and a 975
so here's what happens
so i came in and i remember the speech so well
so i didn't mention that okay
so i get along with labor
so i had a couple of experts come in i said 
so i just wanted to tell you i look at a 401k who has 401ks here
so i said 
so i said 
so i said 
so i said 
so i said in my letter to pelosi 
so i said to these guys you going to see just like central casting i said i said 
so i'll be able to tell my kids someday and everybody else 
so i'm not knocking him because he gave us a lot of nuggets but we had a lot of those nuggets
so instead they go into this horrible horrible really polluted water and the water comes out of there
so it's a much less expensive it probably gives a better light
so it's really thrilling to be here
so let's say over here in battle creek where's your nearest dump
so many great schools but they need help
so now did you see what the democrats did a couple of days ago
so only 71 years best
so our last us armed forces the last branch was the air force right
so she calls me up like eight months ago
so that means nancy pelosi said no the statement that he made up
so that's it
so that's what i see
so the house democrats are surrendering their majority their dignity their reputations
so then the president of ukraine who's a quality person said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever
so these really countries that come in prime ministers presidents sometimes dictators those we can't deal with too much
so they use this fake dossier and they brought it before this big deal court
so think of these people
so under president bush for eight years you saved $450 meaning you took in 450 bucks
so we had i don't know 14 15 debates
so we have a great deal with mexico with canada
so we have great military we have great judges we have great everything
so we just came out with a reg on dishwashers
so we left a little stuff for the union because we figured to get it signed we'll give a little bit and we did it and we have one great deal
so we set records at every arena
so we want to take back the house we'll hold the senate and we'll keep the white house
so we will have invested in our military since i'm here which is less than three years
so we won wisconsin
so we'll miss them
so we're bringing back standards that are great and better machinery that you can have the water again right
so we're bringing back the old light bulb
so what happens
so what happens is bill clinton said to crooked hillary his very dishonest wife crooked hillary
so why is he allow to do that
so yesterday i sent pelosi a letter denouncing and condemning her party's outrageous abusive power
so you know what they do
so you know what we do out of that big check that we get all that money flows into the treasury
so you leave the water going 10 times as long it's the same thing
so you're back
so you're obviously doing well if you can travel around like that right
some of them don't like me
some people it's good so people but can you imagine
some people say 
somebody said 
sometimes they'll go south and that's okay whatever
soon as i mentioned that boom they went up like rocket ships and they won their elections and it was great
spent two and a half trillion dollars made in the usa
stay right where you are
stealth
storm not sanitary storm and it goes right out into the pacific ocean into the beaches and we fine los angeles and san francisco but we've just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what they're doing
sure
take down the flags
talk about the fact that you have sanctuary cities
tell me what gives a better light
tell me what i did please

thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border illegal crossings are down 75% since may and we've ended catch and release
that crazy new york times one of the worst newspapers in the world one of the most dishonest newspapers in the history of the world totally phony
that doesn't work
that goes right into your pockets
that helps
that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of god
that may be a record that will last forever
that means it was election day when i started speaking
that sounds good to me
that state let me down
that was a killer for the democrats right
that was a long time ago
that was a piece of a deal
that was a schumer deal
that was like throwing a rock at a hornet's nest
that was many many decades ago
that was my baby
that was the only building i had a problem within the whole car industry right
that would have been it
that would have ended your auto industry
that'll be all finished
that's a good idea
that's a killer
that's a long time ago
that's a mafia statement okay
that's a terrible thing and we fight for it now
that's all right
that's all right
that's all right
that's all they want
that's eight years
that's enough
that's fine
that's great
that's it
that's not easy
that's not too bad
that's okay
that's okay
that's okay don't worry about it
that's perfect
that's right
that's some vote right lee
that's strange
that's the head of the mafia saying 
that's the other problem
that's what it is
that's what the word is
that's what they didn't get from china
that's what they think
that's what we do right
that's what you had to do by law
that's when they don't pay their rent right
that's why they call him mayor pete right
that's why we got that vote
the 401ks where people are up 90% they're up 97% they're up 82%
the american people the democrats took the people of michigan for granted but with us you will never be forgotten again
the baby's going crazy and they're getting up
the basketball court
the best in 71 years
the blue collar worker
the blue collar worker is going up the most
the border patrol people were in more danger than the criminal aliens coming in and some of these people are not good people
the chairman of the woman's workers and workers for trump and a proud union autoworker terry bowman who's been so terrific
the country is doing better than ever before
the crowd outside
the democrats are lousy politicians they really are
the drug companies didn't want the liability the country didn't want the liability the insurance companies didn't want the liability
the far left democrats have never been more extreme than they are now
the fbi then took that fake dossier and they used it in the fisa court to get approval to spy on my campaign
the first person i see carolyn maloney
the first time they say 
the forgotten men and women of this country will never ever be forgotten again
the globalists are passe
the headline was 
the individual mandate is now gone
the individual mandate just a little while ago it came over the wires it was just upheld
the most unpopular part of obamacare
the new usmca has powerful protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in michigan where they belong
the old light bulb which is better
the only bad thing is you won't see me too much anymore
the people are trying to impeach us for doing all of the things that they've wanted to do for so many years
the people that made these trade deals it's like where do they come
the planes used to go around and around don't land don't land
the president of the united states 
the prisoner has not acted-
the problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write
the radical left in congress is consumed with hatred and envy and rage
the regulations were taking it down
the republican party has never been so affronted but they've never been so united as they are right now ever never
the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and the american dream
the republicans are known as it's always harder to stick together
the republicans aren't as vicious
the republicans look i've said it for a long time
the sanctuary cities are a disaster and let me tell you the people of california they don't like sanctuary cities either
the second time they say 
the second year was 16
the stupid washington post they have pinocchio
the taxes were taking it down instead of being up 92% or whatever you're up a lot you would have been down you would have been at less than half
the thing i'm happiest about african american unemployment the lowest in the history of our country
the truth is we need more people
the united states attorney general attorney general of the united states could speak to you it would be great
the way they were going they were gone
the whole country is doing the best
the whole country's doing the best
the work we could be doing on lowering drug prices on getting rid of these horrible horrible situations
the worst statement i've ever heard
the yellow vests
their poverty levels they had a horrible poverty level in the negative sense now their poverty levels are the best they've ever been in the history of our country
then all of a sudden and now for the last couple of weeks we've set brand new records in the history of the various stock markets
then finally i said two weeks out i said 
then he talked about michigan
then his foreign minister said the same thing
then i went i did one in grand rapids right
then remember he said

and he won't even know what transparency is
and he's standing there by himself and he's looking like he's not playing games
and here's the guy that said i made a mistake when i banned china that nothing's going to happen
and how bad did he do in that though
and how bad were the democrats to israel
and i can do away with this stuff but i did this too
and i can't go to airbus which is made in europe
and i did predict that
and i didn't politick you at all
and i get to this gorgeous beautiful place
and i go before these crazy people they're screaming like maniacs
and i guarantee they're in the state department
and i had a great relationship but now i feel differently
and i have stayed uninvolved and we do have an excellent attorney general
and i hear it's got the best iron ore anywhere in the world
and i heard from the governor of texas great guy greg abbott
and i helped a lot too
and i like tom cruise by the way because you can't get much better than top gun right
and i look outside at those police
and i never get the right answer because there are people down deep
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i said that a couple of weeks ago remember i said 
and i said to him 
and i said to my people four months ago i said 
and i say 
and i still won the debate and she had all the questions
and i think ted's appreciated it
and i was very impressed by the statement
and i went to see the program and i met some of the pilots and these guys are better looking than tom cruise
and i'd go around telling my people 
and i'll be honest he's a smart guy
and i'll never forget
and i'll tell you the police did a great job
and i'm going to look at jason i'm going to say 
and i'm only here because of him and joe
and i'm saying this for you and i'm saying it for all of you
and i'm standing in the lincoln bedroom
and i'm the one that signed it
and i'm up at the incredible suite level and there's abraham lincoln's suite
and i've only won one election but it's for the president of the united states
and it comes under it's like a corkscrew right at the bottom of the plane
and it goes into effect on january 1st
and it opens up and if it's raining or windy you're covered sir because it's under the plane
and it saved the industry
and it says 10 years
and it's complex
and it's happening with so many other things
and it's like an unlimited amount
and it's my honor
and it's the same thing as joe
and jefferson and lincoln
and larry cuffe is here
and mark meadows did a great job
and michelle has my complete and total endorsement
and new york people are going to do it
and nobody has showed up in four months to take down a statue
and nothing happens to her
and now with the phones i think there's like 22 or 24 people
and now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for minnesota
and on november 4th the press will probably say let's say something stupid happened
and one of those things i was very early and i banned and everybody admits that had i not banned highly infected wuhan province right
and our guys better get on the ball
and our numbers on the border are the best they've ever been
and pulitzer association the committee should ask for those prizes back
and remember this and i really appreciate this thank you
and remember this is a big much bigger than the old 747
and robert e
and saturday night nobody showed up
and she controls nancy pelosi
and she was the one that brought it up
and so they all said 
and some schmuck back there said 
and speaking of north korea and you know it's okay to have really
and thank heavens for ice and thank heavens for border patrol because these people do a job that you don't want
and that wall is going up think of that
and that was because his general was killed who's going to lead gettysburg
and that's okay
and that's what happened that night the night of the election
and that's where these guys begin
and that's why the supreme court is so important
and the judges which we've done at a level like nobody's ever done everything we've done
and the next day they said 
and the old act said if you rip down a monument or a statue you get 10 years in prison
and the only one i could think of is ted because he's going to get 50 republican votes and he's going to get 50 democrat votes
and the other clown will be in office
and the traffickers and drugs are way down
and then boeing came to me and i love to negotiate
and then he said 
and then he was going to be able to negotiate
and then i did it and just week after week one out two out three out four out
and then i get to the most beautiful house in the world
and then i go up and make one speech and i call them concast and that's the end of the pr for the year
and then i spoke to the head of boeing a very nice guy
and then people automatically vote
and then she goes around and calls us all like what the hell are we
and then she hit her phones with a hammer
and then somebody says 
and then the fake news
and then they say 
and then they vote for a democrat
and then we're supposed to protect germany from russia
and then we've done changes
and then what happened
and then you can probably add another four to that
and then you had the chart
and then you take guys so many so many
and these arab countries would have their beautiful 747 800s 900s pour in and they were gorgeous
and they are available
and they don't even know
and they had the most beautiful trump flags
and they have my complete endorsement
and they only call the election immediately if you win in a landslide it's got to be tremendous
and they said 
and they said it about ohio too
and they said it four years ago 
and they should return the pulitzer prize
and they spend a fortune
and they took away the incentive and puerto rico went down a long way
and they took these guys out and they were fairly tough
and they went crazy
and they were marching on washington
and they were so proud
and they'll say what a job he's doing this president
and they're all going to do it
and they're doing a good job over there
and they're going to be happy as hell jason
and this guy is going to win texas by a hell of a lot of votes
and thousands of people that couldn't get in and i'm working my ass off
and together we are taking back our country
and together with the incredible people of minnesota and you know what's going to be operating at strength
and we brought nasa back
and we caught them spying on my campaign
and we did price transparency
and we get along
and we had a big texas rancher
and we had an attorney general that didn't have a clue
and we saved the industry because i got russia and saudi arabia to cut back 10 million barrels
and we will end our reliance on china once and for all
and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in god we trust
and we will make america great again
and we're catching them
and we're doing great
and we're going to have a better year coming up
and we're the number one in history in regulation cuts which is the biggest thing
and when they try it a guy like biden that can't carry his jockstrap
and wisconsin rarely
and yet he's running for the presidency
and yet you're still paying very low gasoline prices at the pump but we saved 10 million jobs
and you know he's got a lot of people that are deep staters whatever you want to call them
and you know i have an instinct about things pretty much
and you know if i was wrong they would but they can't question me because when you see right to try we took care of our vets
and you know it's a funny thing
and you know it's starting today in minnesota
and you know why i did it
and you probably heard me today
and you're going to get so tired you're going to say 
and you're going to keep winning and winning and winning
and you're going to send jason to the us senate
and you've taken three years of total investigation
andrea zupancich where is she
aoc aoc is running a campaign against the guy that was supposed to be speaker of the house
aoc gets rid of $2000 000
are you campaigning against this maniac
aren't you supposed to get licensed
at least a good president
at least you know one thing
be careful
because by the time i got there it was just scheduled
because he can't draw a crowd
because he didn't think we had a problem
because i owe it to these incredible mayors that were so nice to me
because i wanted to make sure that i had somebody on a list we had about 45 unbelievable people unbelievable
because i went to mobile alabama
because if you don't get it right we will not have a country anymore
because it's the same thing
because this is a protest
because you know why
because you've heard the other one
been to washington i guess 17 times i never stayed over
believe me
beto o'rourke who's in charge of guns
between a governor and a mayor the crime is through the roof the corruption is incredible it's a sad thing that's happened to new york
biden
biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban to jihadist regions jihadist regions
biden has promised a 700% increase in the manifesto with bernie right
biden will overwhelm your children's schools overcrowd their classrooms and inundate your hospitals
big difference between four years ago and now
big state great state
bill barr
boy are you good
boy we almost had it last time
bring that sucker up immediately to the oval office because there are a lot of people coming to washington
but after four or five times asking i'm a loyal person and i did it
but ali velshi i don't know anything about the guy but i know he was standing there
but allowed her to get away with that is a disgrace
but at some point you got to buy a plane for the country
but beto o'rourke he did the story and he was going to defeat ted cruz
but between her and how about aoc
but boy did you get your money's worth tonight
but communists are a hell of a lot worse and that's where we'd be headed
but forget about that
but he does have enthusiasm to beat trump
but he is he's a high quality guy
but he was a great general
but he was against the ban
but he's a sharp as you can be
but he's getting tougher and tougher
but he's going to be fantastic
but he's sort of grandfathering it
but he's the one that two months later called me xenophobic and he called me a racist because i was banning china which was heavily infected
but historically that never wins
but home it's so sad what the democrats have done to our great new york
but i actually do on the other side
but i appreciate this because nine democrat mayors of cities in the iron range have endorsed me over sleepy joe
but i don't believe it
but i even said 
but i get off the plane and they said 
but i had one
but i hope you appreciate that we had a period of time when they were ripping down all of the statues and monuments
but i said 
but i said it was incredible
but i say this
but i think it's better if i stay uninvolved
but i won wisconsin
but i'll tell you a little story
but i'll tell you the white house is still the white house no matter how you do it
but i'll tell you what's changed is the fact that we have more enthusiasm now than we did four years ago
but i'm in texas and let me tell you texas appreciated it because that industry was in deep trouble because all of a sudden with the pandemic there was no demand
but i'm thrilled to be here with the beautiful great hardworking people of this incredible state
but if biden wins china wins and it's very simple
but if we're up to biden your state would be in ruins
but if you look they don't want me to win
but if you vote for me i'm the difference and i'm the wall
but isn't that sort of a good thing
but it allows me to say whatever i want about this guy
but it just shows when you have leaders when you have a great general
but it was too late
but it worked for him
but it's my fault
but it's not
but it's terrible
but it's the most sophisticated two planes
but jason you're in good shape wow
but joe he's off the scale
but joe's energy is far lower
but just to get back to the others
but maybe i'll come over to see mike
but no administration obama bush they didn't want to do it because it sounds luxury
but no it's true
but no way he gets worse
but one thing i learned is that president xi of china is sharp
but please remember i did this too
but remember barbara streisand used to stay in that suite
but robert e
but robert e
but robert e
but russia got that information from the obama administration
but said 
but seriously take a look at the aoc
but she deletes her emails
but she gets a subpoena from congress
but she used to stay there
but so they had four or five lines
but somebody has to go in and clean it up
but thanks michelle
but that didn't work out
but that was it
but that's all you do
but that's the way it is
but that's what it is
but the great thing about those beautiful planes they have more televisions than any plane in history
but the next one we'll have anywhere from one to four
but the one thing i said is we want trump
but the police were much tougher
but these guys all got it right
but these guys are better looking than tom
but these guys keep saying it's in play
but these people they're anarchists and the only thing they understand is strength
but these stupid people that run they get $40000000 a year and they're weak
but they all had one thing in common
but they all made the exact same mistake
but they did it and we've done a great job and the people of that great state they understand it and i just hope the people of your state of minnesota understand it because we don't have too many more chances with this stuff
but they didn't want to do it that way
but they don't know quite what we have but they know we have stuff that they never even heard of before
but they get two
but they got the prize right
but they said texas is in play
but they say we had a smattering of people
but they should give the pulitzer prize to the people that got it right and they should withdraw from all of those writers many of whom are back there right now all of those writers they should do that
but they tried to me-too him
but they work
but they're cable so i guess there's a different standard
but we are making a lot of progress if you see what's going on
but we can buy a stairwell for the plane
but we did the right thing
but we don't really need him because this is the greatest single assemblage of talent ever assembled for one party
but we had no cell phones in that day right
but we have an idea what they're ripping down
but we have done some job with that
but we have now one that's much faster than that
but we have the most powerful weapons ever conceived by man
but we told and found this old act
but we'll hire more police increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities which are a disaster
but we're getting down to all of it
but we're riding down the beautiful pennsylvania avenue
but were talking about that
but what am i going to tell you
but when you look at it when you look at it our country is amazing
but when you're flying these planes you can land that sucker you have no problem
but when you're using the public airwaves free
but why don't we just call it a protest
but you have a lot of groups of people just like this every place we go
but you know she had no money nothing
but you know you wouldn't do it because he couldn't do it
but you remember it was going to be a nuclear war and i got along with him
but you saw the head of the fbi yesterday started going russia
but you think about it and he said 
but you're getting used to winning and you're going to see winning like you've never seen before
but you're going to win
but you're not allowed to do that
by contrast i rescued the minnesota iron range i did that
by the way are they still trying to get rid of your police force in minneapolis
by the way did you see the anderson cooper thing last night
by the way he's going to take your guns away
by the way these pilots are the best pilots
by the way this is one of many stories
by the way we had that great crowd in wisconsin
by the way you do that you've got problems in court big problems
by the way you have a senator that he's running against

i don't think it works for me right
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so right
i don't think so right
i don't think that happened with him

i don't think they're going to do too well in texas
i don't understand it
i don't want to be beto
i don't want to see people killed
i don't want to watch but i have an obligation

i have to say or a wendy's
i have to say to myself i say 
i have tremendous enthusiasm as we can tell
i haven't been doing it long
i haven't looked at it
i haven't said it in a long time because we've been doing a lot of winning but you're going to win so much
i hear trump wants to come in
i heard the first one i said 
i hope you're having a good time tonight

i said to myself 
i save $200 million in about a minute and a half phone call
i saved your iron range

i say it all the time
i say mike is the single greatest purchaser of commercials in history
i say mike lindell
i say mike the pillow man
i say this look i could be home
i sent tank busters right to ukraine
i signed a law
i signed an executive order because obama took your iron range and biden took your iron range away
i signed an order
i signed it
i speak to her all the time
i think he just wanted to get even with you i don't know
i think he's getting tougher and tougher and tougher every day
i think he's given away classified information
i think he's not going to put up with this stuff
i think i have lousy political instincts
i think i have my hair done
i think it was great
i think it worked out great
i think of a 31 years old air force one is 31 years old the main air force one not this
i think that just disrespected the people of minnesota today they gave us the little one
i think they are a bunch of thugs
i think they're just a bunch of thugs
i think we won by like nine points
i think we're going to have a winner here
i think you had a little bit short runway
i think you're getting into a plane that cost 5
i think you're starting to see it
i think you're winning by 15 points
i think you've got the worst
i thought it was good
i told one of the senators that came in he came into my office there 
i told the story in wisconsin last night
i trust these pilots
i want him to buy my commercials
i want to have it or not have it right
i want to take down that statue
i want to thank you fake news
i want to use a teleprompter to answer
i wanted to say
i wanted to stop 
i was at like a semi debate with his idiot a reporter
i was born to run for president
i was going to tell you before
i was loyal to somebody
i was there 17 times
i was with ted all the way
i watched over the last three days i'm saying 
i went to michigan we won michigan
i wish i could wear those hots
i wish you had a mic
i won't even mention names
i won't mention the name
i won't talk about it because i don't want to give away any classified information
i won't use names
i won't use names but we give the pulitzer prize to the new york times
i wonder if he likes me
i wouldn't be good in that business
i'd go down about 22 points
i'd like to endorse you
i'd love to be attorney general
i'll come and see mike
i'll do it for you again
i'll give you another one
i'll give you another one
i'll tell you these hangers are great
i'll tell you what
i'm being totally serious now
i'm competing against somebody
i'm down nine
i'm getting out of here
i'm glad that at least you got a good location right
i'm going to stay uninvolved
i'm going to take down that statue
i'm not even saying what kind
i'm not even sure if he knows
i'm not going to watch my competition who wouldn't
i'm not happy
i'm only here because of him
i'm pleased to tell you something sir
i'm putting ted cruz as one of the people for the supreme court
i'm saying to myself 
i'm talking about a little this is a massive operation with thousands of people and everything else
i'm the one that exposed it
i'm the one that exposed the pipeline with germany
i'm your wall between the american dream and chaos
i've been a senator for a long time
i've been doing this for 30 years
i've been listening for six months 
i've been saying it for a long time and the fake news nobody even questions me about it
i've been watching it for years
i've just been me-too'd darling what does that mean
i've learned a lot as president
i've never hit a phone
i've never hit him with a hammer
i've never seen anything like it
i've won many elections i've only lost twice in my life
if a republican did that they'd be in jail
if biden gets in it's closed
if he does that's the end of his career right
if i got along with putin
if i lose minnesota if i lose minnesota jason i'm going to blame jason if i lose
if i'm a fracker i don't want to be grandfather
if it were up to biden and it's not
if not all of them
if one's not working perfect you use the other one
if only trump moved faster
if only trump moved one week sooner
if she is she's not getting her money worth
if they ever did a number on this guy would be there he'd be laying on the floor crying 
if they're closed just stand in line like you do
if they're closed what the hell time is it now
if they're reporting fake news how come they can keep getting a license
if we do one
if you can get the look for free that's good too
if you had any flare-ups we'll send them in again
if you owned a mcdonald's hamburger stand in a reasonably busy area would you have joe biden running that stand
if you take a look at portland the governor can't quite do it
if you think about it
in all fairness tucker was very good
in fact i went to my wife i said 
in fact when we landed they said 
in other words they've got no enthusiasm for him
in other words we give them $250 million we get nothing
is anybody having a bad time
is mike pence doing a good job by the way
is she there
is that bad
isn't it damn disgraceful that she gets away with it
isn't it nice when you have the option because you have this and you have the option to go either
isn't this better than going and saying 
it actually was probably 18
it doesn't matter
it doesn't say you get 10 years but you can take it down to three weeks
it even makes the people that sometimes not everybody here likes happy because outside is better
it has to mature mature mature
it says 10 years
it sounds like a lot of money to me general 5
it sounds very high
it started at one in the morning
it started today
it used to be puerto rico did tremendous dollars in medical supplies
it was a big thing
it was a depressed kind of a thing
it was already voting day
it was done by the obama administration
it was election day
it was his opening or something
it was just a slow walk right forward
it was like from 200 years ago it was crazy
it was nothing
it was over it was closed
it was pathetic
it was signed actually
it was so close they called it before they even said the doors closed
it was supposed to end immediately because the north was too powerful for the south
it was time
it wasn't that
it wasn't that but when you think of it they wrote it out
it wouldn't work for me too well
it's $250 million
it's 250 sir i'm so proud of that
it's 31 years old and other people didn't want to do it but it was time to get a new one
it's a bunch of thugs and anarchists that are being funded by somebody and find out who the somebody is
it's a criminal act
it's a criminal act you know that right
it's a curtain
it's a different standard and it's a disgrace
it's a friendly protest
it's a friendly protest
it's a great state
it's a hell of a way to travel
it's a little hard i got to go to their competitor
it's a lobbyist deal
it's a massive thing
it's a protest against stupidity
it's a shame
it's a smattering of people
it's a very modern crime and it's an unbelievably profitable crime
it's about $48000000 investigating me before i won and after i won
it's all going because of me
it's all okay
it's amazing right
it's an amazing country
it's beautiful but it's an old 747 right
it's been great and the arenas are good but usually you have to travel 45 minutes
it's better and we're rounding the turn on covid by the way
it's bigger than healthcare
it's boring but i got to watch
it's called disinformation
it's called the lincoln bedroom
it's crazy
it's crazy
it's criminal
it's different world
it's effective also very complicated
it's far lower
it's good
it's having a tremendous impact on all of the different things
it's in play
it's just an idea
it's just an ideology
it's like a habit
it's like blackmail money right
it's like crazy
it's like your curtain
it's never happened before
it's not even children
it's not the way they treat sleepy joe
it's not worth the broken legs
it's on your medical
it's one of the great pictures of all time
it's out of habit but i think the habits we're breaking those habits very quickly
it's probably true
it's so phony
it's such a shame
it's terrible
it's the biggest thing
it's the craziest thing i've ever seen
it's the people that's around him
it's the same way that i'm down nine points in minnesota
it's true
it's true
it's true
it's true
it's unbelievable
it's unbelievable
it's unbelievable
it's very simple
it's with a comma like a comma right
its up very nicely
jason jason please please jason go to the president
jason please please jason
jeb was on the low side
joe biden is wholly owned and controlled by the left wing mob
joe crowley
joe's got nothing going
just let us have it for
just like i was saying before texas they don't want god they don't want oil they don't want guns
just shutting it down
just so you know o-biden
just take a look at what they've done and i'm going to hit it hard
just tell him i'm very unhappy
just today we deported as you know very well dozens of somali nationals charged or convicted with very grave crimes including rape assault robbery terrorism and murder of course
just trust me some more sophisticated sucker you've ever seen in your life

millions of phone calls made not one to russia

no you got to change the rules
nobody cared
nobody even knows who the hell she is
nobody ever saw anything like it
nobody has done more in three and a half years no administration three and a half
nobody showed up the next day
nope abraham lincoln got the worst press
not as long as i'm here
not as we know it
not even as president
not good
not in a lawsuit against some guy that hates you and you're fighting and you're fighting or something
not quite
nothing for him but to beat trump
nothing happens
nothing happens
now all i'm doing is telling the world we have the most powerful weapons in the world
now he's against it for months
now historically we have the biggest gap in enthusiasm of any campaign that they've ever opposed
now how angry
now i just saw another plane
now i would say sean hannity and lou dobbs and laura and tucker
now in congress the way it is now the most you get is about a $10 fine
now it is an ideology
now it's the number one space center in the entire world by a factor of five
now it's very technical there's a lot of stuff
now maybe they don't honor it but i would say they'll go substantially higher than that number
now people are starting to say 
now that doesn't mean in three years that it won't be obsolete because that's what happens
now they don't do i guess the pulitzer prize for that stuff but they probably should
now they then said 
now they used to say 
now they're sitting on a round table and they're on television
now think of how angry it makes me when i see it
now we got upset with the pandemic but i watched biden today talking about 
number two if he does he's just doing it for fun and he'll be out by september and then he'll go about leading his life but he's not going to do it
obama's now campaigning
oh by the way they happen to be totally deleted
oh good
oh he said 
oh he's going to attack
oh here they are
oh i think i'm going to vote for joe biden everybody
oh joe biden
oh man
oh no he's in trouble
oh she's a warrior i can tell
oh that poor joe
oh that's good
oh that's great
oh that's only one guy
oh they must've made a mistake
oh they should have closed one week earlier
oh trump will get rid of social
oh well he got a bit because he was good with negotiating with these other countries

one of my attorneys he did a great job
one of my enemies said that
one of the greatest inventions in history
one of the most vital issues in this election is the subject of refugees
one week
onstage with all these crazy people and they don't want any energy
opening the flood gates to radical islamic terrorists
or msdnc
or you wouldn't have that great statue on the horse of a great general
our vaccines are coming
owned by a company called concast
paul to st

pelosi goes out and says 
people forgot how good he was as a man
people said 
people that now we caught cleaned up their phones
people were here two days ago trying to get in here
please remember that because i have all this list of incredible things i've done for minnesota i won't even touch it because frankly i'm tired of repeating what i've done for all these different states
please remember this is not a rally
politicians that got elected as democrats i don't think they changed their party affiliation but they endorsed trump
president trump is down nine in minnesota
probably classified
probably the guy who wrote the story lost his job at the new york times
proud citizens like you helped build this country
put a lot of guys in jail
put a lot of people in jail that shouldn't be in jail weissman
put anybody in there
putin as sharp as you can be

russia russia russia
russia stole that information
s
said you're the best candidate we could ever hope for
same exact one
sanctions sanctions
see him in the oval office
see joe doesn't have the option
see the plane
see they never learn
she came in here
she can't get there
she does nothing nothing
she gave a great speech
she gave a great speech at the republican national convention at the white house
she goes to a meeting the other day everyone's trying to figure out who is she
she spent $2000000 on bullshit
she spent the $2000000 and big story
she was the one that brought it up and then he goes 
she's a hundred percent crooked
she's done so many criminal acts
sir it gets very windy up there
sir it's $5
sir should i use turn the sucker off
sir that's the best price they could get
sir we can break it up for $250 million
sir we can put an extra stairway
sir we have a very short runway could you please hold on
sir you gave our life back to us because obama took our heart out when he closed up the iron range
sir you're doing much better
sleepy joe
sleepy joe based steel real crap
sleepy joe is going to take your guns away
sleepy joe or slow joe
slow joe
slow joe or sleepy joe
slow joe or sleepy joe ready
smart people
so after about four days they couldn't ask because i gave nothing except i gave heart because i don't want to see people killed on their side either
so air force one is a very old plane
so air force one so that's the 757 but they have a 747 which is the big air force one
so air force one they negotiated a price and they had it down for $5
so anyway but just to finish there's no way that i'm nine points down
so captain let me ask you how good is the f-35
so come to think of it he's out there now today
so dig in dig in dig we must right
so do the same thing at the voting booth please
so forget about looking for the emails
so general what are we paying
so get your friends get your family get your neighbors get your coworkers and get out and vote
so he can't run the country
so he said 
so he says 
so he was against it but now his new thing is if only i moved one week earlier but i was earlier than everybody
so he was against the ban
so he went in
so here's what i'm going to do
so home was new york
so i asked my people that
so i had one speech left
so i just appreciate your being here
so i just want to thank those cities
so i look at a crowd and whether i have good instinct or not this is not the crowd of somebody that's going to finish second in the state to a sleepy joe
so i said 
so i said 
so i said 
so i said 
so i said 
so i said 
so i said to the general i said 
so i say 
so i signed that wonderful executive order instituting this really tough law
so i was in texas two weeks ago we had crowds
so i'm in texas and i said to the crowd it was a great crowd and we must have had a hundred thousand people on the road on the highways and roadways waving
so in a certain way i had a lot of experience probably
so it was about the wedding and the yoga lessons
so it's a corkscrew stairwell
so jason please knock them out
so just in conclusion i want to say that over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world
so just scream if you like it
so let's go
so let's go ready
so let's see what happens to them
so many so talented guys
so my friend says 
so she gets a subpoena from the u s congress
so she goes out and she goes into this beauty parlor
so so far i'm not good but it's not good enough
so tell them you're really unhappy we're not going to make the deal but just do it verbally
so the earliest i could get is january 1st
so there's one
so these are democrat politicians and two weeks ago they endorsed us and it's a great thing
so these are just some little stories
so these guys had just gotten there
so these people are sitting at a table
so they came to me 
so they made it a round table
so they say instinct right
so they sent the horses to stop him
so they take the smaller to save about $12
so this is going to be the most important election in my opinion in the history of our country
so to have these four or five circles they put people that way he doesn't have to be embarrassed when he goes to a high school gymnasium and he has 40 50 people
so we see one the helmet
so we signed it
so you have a choice slow joe they're both very appropriate
so you know he was against the ban right
so you mean to tell me that to cancel the order costs $250 million
so you're a little behind the eight ball when you hear that
so you're not happy now
so you're representing the country but they didn't want to do it because it shows luxury for two planes in all fairness
solomon sara carter bongino
some of the people surrounding him they'll say anything and do anything
some of them i don't like even their voices
somebody said 
somebody said 
somebody said 
somebody will go in there and do like a rudy
speaking about stupidity sleepy joe will turn minnesota into a refugee camp
stop him
stop him from winning
stop him from winning so much for minnesota
stop them stop them
subpoena the most important subpoena you can get
take it away from china
ted beat him
tell boeing we're not taking the plane

ten years is a lot to rip down a statue have a little fun especially when they have no idea what they're ripping down
ten years is not acceptable mike
terrible really terrible
texas has closed its doors
texas is in play
texas is in play
texas is in play
texas is not in play
texas is so close we can't even imagine it it's so close
texas when they say in play that means it's too close to call

that didn't work
that means it's a lobby
that place was gone
that sounds great
that sounds very high to me general
that statue's coming down
that sucker is open
that was 25 years ago
that was all gone
that was another one
that was in prime time
that was my fault
that was such a nice thing
that was the end of his career
that was the end of his political career
that was the first right
that was your city and it's a shame it took so long but the governor finally did it at least
that will totally change when you talk about life when you talk about second amendment when you talk about things that are so important to you
that writer should be given the pulitzer prize
that's a bad thing
that's a beauty
that's a big group of people
that's a big state
that's a great state
that's a lot of people
that's because it had more computers and this and that
that's big difference
that's cool man
that's good
that's great
that's great
that's like a slow missile
that's like considered a slow missile
that's not easy
that's not good
that's not good
that's okay
that's one quick story
that's really nice
that's so nice
that's the fake news back there
that's the good news
that's the problem with that business
that's the smaller version of air force one
that's too much
that's true
that's what happened
that's what he'll do
that's what i hear
that's what i hear
that's what i heard
that's what they were really doing
that's what they're going to do
that's what you are and a lot of people haven't been treated right until i came along
that's what you have now
that's what'll happen
that's what's going to happen
that's when it was strong and they had laws
that's why i always like real estate and grab a piece of real estate
that's why i always talk about walls and wheels
that's why i can tell you about aoc
that's why i'm here
that's why they all endorsed the president
that's why you have an obligation to vote for the guy that got you there
the absolute creme de la creme right
the answer is no
the bad news is the drug companies the doctors everybody's angry at me
the battle of new orleans
the beauty
the bed the desk the gettysburg address the beautiful four score and seven years ago
the best minds in the country
the best they've ever been
the day i did it and tom was there a man i don't know who he is he's probably in this massive audience but he came up to me and he was a rough guy and he never cried in his life including at childbirth
the democrat was so bad to you
the entire city was burning down
the good news is most of them are dying
the good thing about these beautiful air force ones right
the greatest talent he's ever seen
the history of the whole thing
the importance and the power of this position are too great
the jefferson memorial
the little circles
the mayor
the mayors know that
the mistakes sometimes you make is because of loyalty but that's okay
the most beautiful flags of me and our great vice president
the most prestigious
the most we can have is ten people
the narrative seems to be russia
the next president will get one two three or four supreme court justices
the night of the election they called the results
the obama administration
the offenders are very dangerous and they'd be running all over your state
the one person he won't pick is kamala because she called him a racist she tried to me-too him
the only thing they understand is strength
the only thing you're allowed to do is run wild through the streets burn down storefronts blow up stores and kill people because that's considered a protest and that they allow you to have
the people of minnesota want to win you're wrong jason
the plane becomes your backstop right
the police
the poor teleprompter guy he's sitting there 
the press will say 
the quality is the best
the quality is the best
the recent poll
the resource theory you think was so different

a group of people came
a lot of people say to me friends of mine they've very successful
a virus starts in china bleeds its way into various countries all around the world doesn't spread widely at all in the united states because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes and the democrats' single talking point and you see it is that it's donald trump's fault right
about 2% come back and they're the ones that are the dumbest people i've ever seen
above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america
actually nobody will know his name because he was on for such a short period of time
address
african american or black
after years of building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country
alan thank you very much
all at the same time
all i can say is that the fake news just doesn't get it do they
all right
all right iowa
all right so wait a minute let's do a poll
all you have to do is ask mini mike
all you have to do is pick up a paper every day
also alzheimer's disease we're really making strides
america is thriving like never before and ladies and gentlemen of south carolina the best is yet to come
an action which the democrats loudly criticized and protested and now everybody's complimenting me saying 
and better
and bringing investment to distressed communities across our country through opportunity zones including 135 right here in south carolina
and by the way tim's incredible mother is right here in the front row
and he says 
and he should have never been in our country
and he went through a whole big thing and i said 
and i want to thank mexico because by the way right now they have 27000 soldiers on our border protecting our border
and i went in and here's the problem
and i'll read stories where one of them recently going up a hill hit 19 times by gunfire grabbing four people bringing them down getting onto a helicopter falling out of the helicopter hitting a tree on the way down
and if you put a microphone with these people back there like the academy awards used to be not anymore
and in north carolina too
and it doesn't mean we won't and we are totally prepared
and maybe i could ask our governor our great governor of this incredible state to say a few words
and my guys that we have the best professionals in the world the best in the world and we are so ready
and normally i like talking about my crowds because i get the crowds like nobody but i just got back from 140 or 50 or 60000 people and now i'm coming here
and now just using this so important right
and she choked
and so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the united states
and some of the fake news knows that but they refuse to report it but that's okay
and some of you maybe know i liked this guy for a long time governor henry mcmaster
and thanks to republicans all over america
and that makes seven million jobs since our election seven million
and that was with no democrat help
and that's a good thing not a bad thing
and then after the debate they're revealing him and they said 
and then if it's legal i always say if it's permissible by law because they have so many little booby traps but they only like getting the republicans
and then name after name after name of people that i never heard of
and they don't do it for mini mike that's for sure
and they had 129
and they never replaced this guy
and they only do that for trump
and they paid me a fortune for years for the apprentice
and they said 
and they said almost immediately 
and they'll leave and they'll say 
and they're going to go nuts
and they're good
and this is their new hoax
and we had an amazing thing
and we tried it
and we're setting records now at the border
and what a killer
and when i left the show it was doing great
and where's alan
and you got the people outside
and you think it's easy getting that kind of money to build a wall when i have a whole party and a deep state and some never-trumpers
and you've all seen the wall has gone up like magic
any men
are they going to think about you
are they going to think about you right
are we allowed to tell them who we would like them to vote for
are you ready
as i introduce somebody and i'll just say stay there because he was brave but he got hit hard
as much as they hate me they hate me
at arenas like this it gets one of the biggest hands because that's where it's at
at stake in our present battle is the actual survival of our nation
at the same time that i initiated the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years
be the end of the road
because they like knives because it's more painful
because they started attacking us and we don't believe in it anymore
because you say 
because you're allowed to skip

but i say so let's get this right
but let me ask you this
but lindsey is a true fighter for south carolina
but nbc i think is worse than cnn
but she sort of smiled
but that's been built
but the country in five years from now of course you want to upset them five years or nine years or 13 years
but the show went down the tubes very quickly after they had trump
but they are tough
but they came to see me a group
but things happen in life and you have to be prepared and you have to be flexible and you have to be able to go out and get it
but this guy steyer he spends all this money
but this is an incredible time for our nation
but watch this
but we did something that's been pretty amazing
but we'll get their help
but we'll see what happens about that
but we're winning
but when we heard those two guys plus our great congressmen they're here great congressmen
but with your help we have exposed the far left's corruption and defeated their sinister schemes and let's see what happens in the coming months
but you know what they say now
but you know what this does show you
but you think it's easy
by the thousands
by the way just in case you haven't heard it is being built
can you believe it
can you believe that
can't do it anymore

he needs eight and a half billion not two and a half
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said something
he shouldn't have been allowed
he spends all of this money and you shouldn't waste your vote on him tomorrow
he turned out to be a total catastrophe
he wished he never started
he would admit that he has a lot of respect for your president but he can't admit it on television
he's a superstar
he's a very special man retired marine corps major general and most of you know he received the congressional medal of honor james e
he's basically given up
he's building the wall
he's building the wall but mexico's not paying for it

i am the president of the united states of america
i ask for two and a half they want to give me eight and a half so i said 
i assume this is okay from a campaign finance standpoint i assume
i called everybody
i called lindsey i called everybody
i called our great first lady over

i can't believe we didn't do this sooner
i did it
i did it and i did the true capital jerusalem right

i don't know what the hell is an address
i don't think he's doing a good job
i don't want to be the president of the world
i don't want to be wrong
i don't want to get them in trouble because the press wants us to be very politically correct
i don't win
i gave it to them and i got it and it was not easy

i never had that before
i never knew it was going to be this dirty and we're getting a lot of help from a lot of great people
i never thought it was this deep
i passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life
i really believe that it's the survival

i've very surprised to hear this
ice has taken them out of our country by the thousands
if anybody would like to give up where you're standing or your seat please raise your hand
if i did that once it would be the end of the road right
if they have money they go to asia they go to europe
if we had the help we could lower it by 50%
if you have no money you can't
if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have towards a victory in november of 2020 november 3rd to be exact
if you're terminally ill you go all over the world
impeachment how did that work out tom hey he spent millions and millions of dollars in iowa right

reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million american families an average of $2200 more in their pocket thanks to the republican child tax credit
remember when president obama would say 
representatives joe wilson jeff duncan william timmons ralph norman tom rice and the chairman of the south carolina republican party drew mckissick
republican not democrat
republicans are fighting for citizens from every background every community and every walk of life
republicans are proudly fighting for nationwide school choice including right here in south carolina
republicans believe america should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans not for criminal aliens
right

so a statistic that we want to talk about go ahead
so elizabeth warren's plan to eliminate america's borders
so fabulous that there's like five people
so he gets up and he starts by saying 
so i don't know what the record attendance is in this arena but i was told that we broke it by a lot
so i think they're going to set up a round table
so important
so important
so important
so let me ask you this
so let me change it around
so let's go through them just quickly
so mini mike i hear mini mike by the way has left

so pocahontas should we leave her in or out
so really we're down to two candidates right
so thank you very much for being here

thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75% since last spring and we have ended catch and release permanently
that didn't work out too well
that ended
that ended
that is not a smattering
that is why i've asked congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of god
that swamp is bad
that was not an easy one
that was not bad
that was on a perfect conversation
that was really a worthwhile trip
that word alone they call it loopholes
that you know
that's a big audience
that's a big deal
that's a good one
that's a horrible thing
that's a lot of cameras
that's not a hundred people
that's not a smattering
that's plenty
that's terrible
that's the end of his evening
that's the end of his political career
that's thousands and thousands of people including people outside
that's too bad
that's what i hear
that's what it is
that's what they say
that's what we're doing
that's what's going to happen
that's what's happening
that's where it's going unfortunately or fortunately
that's where these guys get together and they knock the hell
that's who got happy
that's why
that's why i tell you when we have the flu with 35000 people and this one we have to take it very very seriously
the average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any us president in recorded history
the best is yet to come
the best is yet to come because together we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america proud again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again
the camera just went off
the democrat field also supports deadly sanctuary cities that release violet criminal aliens
the democrat party is the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total obliteration of your second amendment
the democrats
the democrats said 
the democrats want us to fail so badly
the good citizens of south carolina have had a front row seat to the extremism of the democrat candidates
the good thing they're on respirator
the insanity of the democrat party is why millions of registered democrat voters are joining our movement
the lowest rate in all of america
the people around them got happy
the place was packed and they did better than most
the republican party has never ever been unified like it is now
the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and of course the late great abraham lincoln
the spectacular right to try
the stadium holds 100
the unemployment rate among african-americans hispanic americans and asian americans has reached record lows
the unemployment rate here in south carolina has fallen to 2
the unemployment rate in the great state of south carolina
the unemployment rate nationwide has hit the lowest rate in over 50 years
the worst presidential harassment in history
then he goes 
then he said 
then let's begin right
then this van jones has a program that gets no ratings absolutely at all
then we'll go crazy bernie
then we'll go mini mike
there are tough guys in here but anybody want to be an ice officer
there has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now
there was no games in your household
there's no difference
there's such love in the room it's easy
these are two of the greatest guys i know
these people are bad people
these people are crazy
they always show my face
they are
they are
they are great
they are great brave people
they are joining our great new republican party
they are paying for it
they are terrible
they call it loopholes
they call them nest
they came to me a group of people and they wanted criminal justice reform
they can't count their votes
they can't even count
they can't even count their votes in iowa
they couldn't do it
they couldn't even think about doing it and they tried although i don't think they tried too hard bur they could have never done it
they did that seven times
they die from overwork
they don't care about crime
they don't do that for crazy bernie
they don't do that for sleepy joe
they don't get it
they don't get it
they don't have an address
they don't have any clue
they gave me credit for 100000
they go 
they go all over the world
they go into a nest of ms13 and they say 
they go into those nests
they had a big audience
they have a great leader and they have a great love for the people of this country
they have no clue
they have spent the last three years and i can even go further than that three years since the election but we go before the election working to erase your ballots and overthrow our democracy
they just don't get it
they like to say that anyway i guess though
they lost
they make enough stuff for us right
they needed four senators
they needed four senators and maybe five and they needed help with some of the ones that weren't moving in the right direction
they needed help
they never did it
they never do
they never do
they never do it
they never lose those fights
they never show the arena
they never talk about it
they paid me a fortune
they release these horrible criminals to terrorize our communities
they said 
they said 
they said 
they say 
they say usually a minimum of 27 goes up to 100000 people a year die
they show my face
they still don't get it though
they think bernie's easier to beat
they think bernie's easier to beat
they thought it was from the comic strips or the future movies
they thought they got me
they tried anything
they tried it over and over
they tried the impeachment hoax
they use the word smattering a lot
they want open borders
they want to give away everything
they want to take away your healthcare
they want to treat illegal aliens people that come into our country illegally better than they want to treat our military and our veterans
they want to win more than anybody and we're not going to change a thing because we're winning like never before
they want unfettered catch and release
they went back and saved him but he died later
they were incredible
they were very much and i started studying the issue worked hard on the issue and criminal justice reform
they weren't happy they weren't happy about it
they'd been doing it since you got in
they'd say trump has lost it
they'll pass something in the senate
they'll say 
they'll say 
they're a dying breed though
they're a terrible group of people
they're brave
they're doing it outside too
they're fair judges
they're going to come in and say 
they're going to go nuts
they're going to put this all over the place
they're judges that if we feel it's right they don't want to invite the world to trespass across our borders
they're judges that truly love our constitution
they're just as good
they're on mouth to mouth resuscitation
they're on mouth to mouth resuscitation the never-trumpers
they're on respirator
they're only doing that for trump right
they're our friends
they're searching
they're thrilled
they're tough
they're trying to get to a hundred but they're not going to make it
they're willing to hurt our country in order to say bad even if they know it's not so
they're working and they have great jobs and they love getting up in the morning and they're making much more money and it costs our country nothing
they've been trying for 51 years to get that approved
things happen
think of it
think of it
think of it

we are stronger we are better but while we are building a great future the radical left democrats in washington are trying to burn it all down
we are the party of big ideas for the future
we are the party of boundless optimism excitement energy and enthusiasm
we are tired sick tired of winning
we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great american flag and we live by the words of our national motto 
we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true american way
we can't have chokers
we can't have chokers as your president

went through the roof
what do your husbands say about that
what does this place hold 15
what he's done for our veterans is incredible
what is it
what they do is they catch him they get some information that the guy has no idea where he lives and it's one of those things in many cases and then release
what's that all about
when i first said it everybody thought i was joking
when i left the show 14 seasons think of that they got a big movie star
when you have this virus or any other virus or any other problem coming in it's not the only thing that comes in through the border
when you say to them five more years so it's five but you then say maybe nine maybe 13 maybe 17 maybe 21 or not maybe 21
where are you going tonight
where's james
whether it's the virus that we're talking about or many other public health threats the democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all americans
whether it's this character that nobody ever heard of him
while premiums more than doubled in the five years before i took office we are now offering plans already that are up to 60% less expensive than the old obamacare
while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with these vile hoaxes we've been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages enacting fair trade deals securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race religion color and creed
while the washington democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and to destroy your social security
who the hell is easier to beat
who would be the best
who would be the best candidate for us
who would have thought we could have done that
who would've thought this could be going on four weeks ago

with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
yeah it is
yes they are actually
yet the democrat candidates oppose all detention of illegal aliens
you are so far ahead in south carolina that it's meaningless
you can do it
you can hear it
you can hear it because when you hear it that's not 200 people
you can keep your doctor
you can keep your doctor and you can keep your plan
you could keep your plan
you ever hear of that place
you ever see the guy with the note 
you get to use that drug and the results have been unbelievable
you go home and you die
you got a lot of dirty people but you also have phenomenal people in the fbi and other places but we're draining that swamp
you got dirty cops at the top of the fbi
you have a great governor you have two senators great congressman the greatest year you've ever had but some people in south carolina are getting a little tired i'm surprised to hear this of winning
you have the best year ever on record right
you have to be prepared for the worst but hopefully it will all amount to very little
you have to land on moon and then you go to mars
you hear 35 and 40000 people and we've lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode
you know he's the kind of a guy he'll stay in because 
you know that
you know we have the congressional medal of honor and we have the presidential medal of freedom and they're both the highest awards
you know what
you know what
you know what catching release is
you know what that is
you know who got happy
you know why
you never told me it was this bad fellas
you ready
you ready
you saw alice johnson come out of prison

you understand that
you were 100% correct
you wouldn't
you'll have great health care and preexisting conditions will be totally protected
you'll keep your doctor keep your plan

28 times on record 
5 trillion dollars went into our military
a lot of people don't even know that but that's a big deal or no issue have washington democrats more thoroughly betraying the american people than on the issue of immigration sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals to terrorize your communities
about 27000 minimum goes up to 70 sometimes even 80 one year it went up to 100000 people
above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that binds us together as one beautiful america
actually i honestly don't think he knows what office he's running for
african american poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded
after years of rebuilding foreign nations we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own american citizens and all of the things that we've done we've wiped out the terrorists we've done so much and you know what
alice johnson do we love alice johnson
all it means is you're not able to climb over it
all of them knows this
all right
all right we love both places
also with us tonight is a man who's really become a good friend of mine
america is thriving like never before and ladies and gentlemen of north carolina the best is yet to come
american troops cannot be the policemen for the world or to create democracy in other nations that frankly probably don't want it
and by the way speaking of farms factory workers and small businesses are all for the death tax
and he really wants to fight to the radical left and he does it and he knows how to fight and take care of our amazing veterans and stop illegal immigration
and i always say i know a lot of parents that don't love the children very much
and i have to say with a thriving economy the way it is and the most advanced health system on earth america is so resilient we know what we're doing we have the greatest people on earth the greatest health system on earth
and if we lose i'm out of there i save a hell of a lot of money
and it doesn't matter
and miss michigan you see what's going on over there
and remember there was oh this is going to be a quick one
and then you go over and start talking to the mother as to whether or not you execute the baby
and there's not a lot of enthusiasm for biden
and they're going to have something that makes you better and that's going to actually take place we think even sooner
and today he just said super thursday he's looking forward to super thursday
and today we just had the largest one day increase in the stock market in history
and together we are in the midst of the great american comeback
and we learned a lot and maybe that had the impact on the stock market
and we took out the world's top terrorist qasem soleimani ending his evil reign on terror forever soleimani
and we're doing well in pennsylvania i hear and south carolina i know we're doing great there
and we're working with other countries
and you hear about enthusiasm for crazy bernie and that's true he does have some enthusiasm but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people too
and you know eric and lara named their daughter you know what her name is
are you
are you mexican
are you mexican
as we bring back our troops we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to america in the first place
because if it doesn't work the second time it gets embarrassing right
because together we have made america wealthy again
believe me they're under siege
bernie was going wild
billing
bombed
but did you see sleepy joe did you see sleepy joe where he said 
but elizabeth warren's here to plan to eliminate our borders or mini mike's plan to eliminate your second amendment
but he's not going to be running it
but honestly not so much anymore
but if i do that again it's a copy
but if you don't then it doesn't matter because if you don't love your children don't leave them a damn thing but you don't have the inheritance tax anymore which is great
but it didn't matter
but just to finish up so we've made a lot of progress we've really done a great job with it
but no he's a disaster waiting to happen
but that was from north carolina
but the governor of virginia wanted to do that
but the political attacks from some of the democrats really must stop
but there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection think of it keep all of the infection let it come in
but they're going to be super left radical crazies
but they've embraced an extreme left wing agenda
but we're doing fantastically
but you do it once and you sort of say 
but you know those embers were burning a little bit a couple of months ago
by the way i have to say this you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside
by the way look at this
can you believe it
can you believe it
can you imagine if i said super thursday
can you imagine trump saying that
can't do that when you're negotiating with these countries can you
carolina carolina
come here lindsey
come on up lindsey
crazy
crazy bernie is going to go crazy
deliberately set free hundreds and hundreds of and these are really dangerous criminal aliens including those charged or convicted of burglary gun crime sexual assault kidnapping and even suffering they inflict on our people
diamond and silk
did you ever hear of anything like this
do that again where you get down low
do you ever see them run up with a sign 
do you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today
do you think that a guy like sleepy joe's going to put he doesn't know what it means
don't care
don't worry about it it's not going to happen
drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years
earlier today when i met with the pharmaceutical companies things were discussed and learned honestly
eight months from now we're going to defeat the radical socialists
el salvador
even though he comes from a slightly different state but not to far by is somebody that really has distinguished himself he's become a great friend of mine
every day for me and for you it's promises made promises kept
every place that we've gone it's been amazing
everybody saw it
everyone appreciates these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do
everyone said 
everything will be just fine
for decades democratic politicians betrayed and they truly did they betrayed african americans
for sleepy joe he doesn't even know where he is what he's doing or what office he's running for
fox
from 27000 to 70000 people get infected and many people die
from fayetteville to wilmington from raleigh to greensboro from asheville to kitty hawk to right here in charlotte this state is the home to some of the toughest men and strongest women and most incredible patriots ever to walk the face of the earth
george thank you very much for being here
georgia's not in super tuesday
get me off
get me off this stage
he got lucky
he is
he is dead
he said why would i be here tonight
he used horrible language today
he wanted to dance like michael jackson and his wife stopped him
he'll be watching television
he's 100 and he looks good
he's a beauty
he's a mess
he's as mexican as i am
he's been a tremendous supporter and things that we've wanted to do and fights that we've had which were so important he's been right up and lizzie will tell you that he's been right up in front and really he deserves another six year term
he's being interviewed tonight on fox
he's building the wall but mexico's not paying for it
he's doing great
her name is carolina for a reason
hey he's running for the senate
hey how great was the 2016 election
hey take your cameras and spin them around this big arena
his name is george washington perry legit
hopefully nobody in the room needs
hopefully nobody in the room needs right to try
horrible
horrible language
how about that
how are we doing
how are we doing in the state are we doing good
how are we doing lara
how did they do that one
how long is that
how many people here are from south carolina by the way
i called it a long time ago
i came up with that name far too early i should've just waited
i constantly hear about the enthusiasm
i could do anything
i could get
i could get anything
i created space force
i didn't know that
i don't know
i don't know if you saw
i don't think so
i got it done
i got to have him say something come here lindsey great guy
i guess you heard that right
i have a few great friends of mine and they love north carolina
i have more indian blood in me than you have and i have none
i hear he's way up in the polls he's way up in the polls
i hear it all the time
i know what i means
i looked at the first lady i said 
i love the scene
i mean i have to say that about my son but i know a lot of people don't like their sons that much but lara has been fantastic and thank you very much what a job
i passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life
i probably have more in me
i really believe it
i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i saw them again they're unbelievable
i saw them i fell in love with it and everybody fell in love with diamond and silk
i signed an executive order opposing price transparency that's going to be bigger than healthcare because when providers are required to show their prices those same prices fall very very fast
i think crazy bernie is going to be more crazy when they see what they're doing
i think he's been tremendous
i think it this way if we win nobody cares
i think you're in great shape
i thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said he's running for the senate
i thought she was making a come back
i took a lot of heat
i took a lot of heat for that
i understand that
i want to thank you very much
i was going to say the you know what thing i held it back because they'll say 
i went to border patrol i said 
i would be over
i wouldn't do this
i'd also like to recognize so important a woman who's really helped us win north carolina in 2016 i have a feeling this year she'll even do better because she happened to grow up here lara trump and my son eric trump
i'd get down real low but i don't want to copy him
i'll only come back here a few times a year
i'm going to end it the first day
i'm sure they were thrilled
i'm thrilled to back in the great city of charlotte where by the way we're having our convention
if i wanted 25 cents for the wall they didn't want to get it
if we don't i'm going to be so angry at you
if we make a tiny mistake it's headlining
if you lose nobody cares what room you're in
if you want to end sanctuary cities in north carolina and across america then you have only one choice
if you want your children to inherit the blessings of generations of americans who fought and died to secure and you know what they're securing they are securing us they're securing our freedom then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november november 3rd to be exact
impeach him
impeach him
impeach them
in a part of the wall a couple of weeks ago they were climbing the wall and the fire department had to come and take them down
in all fairness look it's a problem we're working with other countries
in fact she'll probably lose the state of massachusetts to bernie
including sweeping travel restrictions
is that right
is there anybody in this room that does not love your children
it can be much more
it can only be
it doesn't matter as long as you win
it is very tough
it was a big hit
it was depleted but we've rebuilt it $2
it wasn't
it would be over right
it's a big thing
it's a big thing
it's a copy
it's a little more expensive
it's a no climb
it's being rigged against crazy bernie
it's called a no climb provisor no climb provisor
it's called opportunity now you know about it
it's called the inheritance tax
it's called va choice
it's going great
it's great to be in idaho
it's great to be in the state of ohio
it's like elizabeth warren
it's more money
it's nice to know people can handle pressure there aren't too many of them
it's not even to be laughed at
it's wrong
jobs are booming in our country incomes are soaring poverty has plummeted confidence is surging and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the united states military
joe
killing her and dumping her body into the woods
last month here in charlotte we launched a nationwide campaign to create a better future for all americans
last month we added 225000 new jobs in january alone
last year 150 million people were killed by guns in our country
last year alone sanctuary jurisdictions in north carolina how did that happen to north carolina

median household income has reached the highest level ever recorded think of that
mexico is paying for the wall

my administration is delivering for african americans like never before
my administration is protecting your social security your medicare and is fighting to give you great healthcare
my job is to protect the health of american patients and americans first and that's what i'll do

nah i got to have more
never never
no
no country is better equipped than america to handle new threats and no people are more skilled talented tough or driven than americans
no democrat's going to this
no fun to be a protestor at a trump rally but do we have a great time at a trump rally
no he said 
no i really mean it
no matter how good you are at certain things you can't as an example a name like sleepy joe he's constantly naming the wrong state
no no
no no
no no no i'm sorry you're in north carolina
no no north carolina joe
no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school
no president has done more for our black community no president has done more for our black community and it's an honor to do it
no that was great thom
no thom is going to be great
no you're in iowa
no you're not
nobody
nobody else could have done this
nobody knew
nobody knows that
nobody that's because we're north carolina you love your children
nobody told me that
nobody wants the run
north carolina republican party chairman michael whatley
north carolina thank you very much
not going to happen for him
oh
oh
oh i know i hear that all the time
oh this is terrible
once that happens you might as well leave the states because it's a disaster no matter how good you're doing
one more hand for thom tillis please
one of the greatest nights one of the most highest rated television nights in the history of television
one of the greatest statements ever made in the united state's senate senator lindsey graham
one of the most important promises i made is right to this era
one thousandths so i was right
one year was much higher than the 70000 number
only in north carolina
only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp which is by the way much more vicious much dirtier much deeper than i ever thought but we are kicking ass
other people are going to
our country is stronger than ever before
our historic investments in the united states military include $200 million to a place that nobody's heard of in this audience i'm sure fort bragg
out
out last night
pavarotti
please raise your hand
please raise your hand
probably a lot longer than that but he's going to come up and i'm going to ask senator thom tillis come on up
probably almost almost five years ago she said 
protecting preexisting conditions
proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
quid pro quo
quid pro quo
quid pro quo that's why
quid pro quo they made a deal
remember president obama
remember they used to say with me 
remember this over the last long period of time the flu the common flu you know this right
remember when i closed the borders to certain areas of the world
right
right
right
right
right here in north carolina believe it or not the sanctuary county of durham released an illegal alien criminal who then receded to viciously murdered a young 19 year old woman last year you know all about it
right now
same blood test
same blood test maybe the cheap one is better who knows
she knows this state better than anybody in this room except maybe this guy right here
she said 
she said 
she said she was an indian
she said the next day she came again
she's history
she's the senator
she's the senator for massachusetts i think she's going to lose it to bernie
should we doing a great job but just an okay job
since my election over 219000 new jobs have been created right here in north carolina
so a lot of good things are happening but we have strong borders and really our tough and early actions have really been proven to be 100% right
so if you want to leave it to your children you can leave it to your children there's no tax to be paid by your children
so many mistakes
so many people came up to me tonight and they want me to fight and we're doing it for school choice so that every child who needs it gets it
so maybe he gets in
so now instead of waiting in line for days and days and weeks and weeks to see a doctor you go outside you get a doctor we pay the bill you get all fixed up
so she doesn't know what to do because you're not supposed to lose the state of massachusetts if you get in there
so she went out and got a test and it turned out not so good for her
so thank you
so they don't have to go back to the evil banker borrow money from the banker lose the farm lose the business it won't happen
so they said 
so we have our professionals in constant touch i'm in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out
so we took a ballroom nice ballroom that's it no big deal
so we're building the wall
so we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many really great terrific brilliant wonderful warriors
so we're working hard on it and we're going to come up with some really great solutions
so when you lose 27000 people a year nobody knew that
some of you understand because i told a few people last week it got linked to the fake news media
some people that have really been helpful to me corey lewandowski david bussey and pam bondi right here
somebody was saying that if pocahontas any one of them sleepy joe he doesn't have that so he doesn't have a lot he has very small crowds but if sleepy joe or if any of them had a crowd one-tenth this size they go around talking about how big the crowd
sounds like they made a deal
spin them around
super thursday
surprise
surprise medical building
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you george
thank you george
thank you michael
thank you north carolina
thank you very much
thanks also to all of the people who are working to make the 2020 republican national convention right here in charlotte an outstanding success rnc chairman ronna mcdaniel rnc co chairman tommy hicks and convention president marcia lee kelly thank you all
that is why i've asked congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of god
that makes seven million jobs since the election
that means 50% of our country
that was great
that was nice don't do it again
that's a big story
that's great
that's great
that's what i think
that's what it is
that's what the no climb is
that's what the no climb is
the average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any us president in recorded history that's happening that's happening
the baby is born
the baby is born and he says 
the baby is born and then he goes over and talks to the mother
the democrat party has gone crazy
the democratic party is the party of high taxes high crime unlimited regulations open borders late term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total obliteration of your second amendment
the doctor will now talk and you'll make a decision as to whether or not the baby lives
the entire democratic party
the governor of virginia
the insanity of washington democrats is why millions of registered democrat voters are joining our movement
the job of the american military is to secure and defend our country
the media didn't know
the media is going to be thrilled when i explain that mexico is paying for the wall because you know now finally they said i've had obstruction like you wouldn't believe
the progress that was made was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform
the renewal of american strength over the last three years means at times of challenge we are the best prepared to rise to any occasion
the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and the late great abraham lincoln
the republicans are claiming that we did that nobody else did but the democrats are saying 
the scene of that convention center where hillary was getting ready to speak and then she found out she lost
the unemployment rate among african americans hispanic americans and asian americans has reached the lowest level in recorded history
the united states is right now ranked by far number one in the world for preparedness
the usmca is a giant for north carolina's incredible farmers and factory workers
the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debate history
the worst in history
their plans would massively raise your taxes destroy our liberty muzzle our faith and erase our sovereignty
then i hear a senator from a state we're going to win we're going to win that state but she dropped out
then you have mini mike
then you have the governor of virginia
there are these two women on the internet they're unbelievable
there's never been a time where the republican party was so unified as it is now
these people would never let me live it down
they all say 
they are joining our great republican party
they both supported sleepy joe
they came and we gave a rally that was like this and dan bishop and gregg murphy won by so much it wasn't even close

5% unemployment
572 people were murdered in chicago last year
8 billion in cash
8 billion we gave them in cash
92% do you believe that
a couple of them gave a grilling
a couple of them you saw the other day they were questioning bob mueller
a lot more a lot more
a lot of people choke
a lot of you so i appreciate it
a sanctuary jurisdiction in california recently released a criminal alien from jail
above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one america
after sanctuary city in new jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence he was arrested in missouri for the murders of three people
ah i'm out of here
all they had to do is mention the facts and it was over
all we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings
already the shipped down 30% of your jobs to mexico
also recognized the legitimate government of venezuelan and we condemn any of the socialist brutality taking place
always
always
american clean beautiful coal
americans won the race to the moon and we will now win the race to mars
and a man who's fantastic son is here tonight who i just met incredible
and accountability
and again remember this ohio is doing better today than it's ever ever ever done before
and also here tonight i don't know did he do a good job
and also the auditor of the great state of ohio a man whose job i made much easier because you have money pouring in
and aman bob paduchik
and bob said 
and by the way tpp trans pacific partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already
and did you ever hear sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it
and he comes to me he goes 
and he said 
and he's done an incredible job
and how we've done this for so many years folks how we've done this
and i came back to my people
and i came in i had 148 openings
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i used to say 
and i would have been in big trouble
and it was because of unions and it was because of other things
and just a few months ago we recognized the golan heights
and kimberly
and mike dewine won that election and he won it easily
and mike pence is doing a great job on that
and no matter what happened no matter how badly we were doing he said 
and only being a politician for a few years
and remember what i said iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago
and right now ohio is the most successful it's ever been in the history of our country
and solar you know what
and something which a lot of people don't talk about but we doubled the child tax credit
and that's because president obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in which is a shame
and that's on top of the 25% that we take off $250 billion coming in from china and don't let them tell you the fact is china devalues their currency
and the biggest beneficiary is the african-american community
and the numbers are way down
and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points
and then they say 
and then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country
and then you'll have like a governor of virginia it's not only late term abortion it's killing the baby after the baby is born
and they said 
and they showed up on election day
and until such time as there is a deal we will be taxing the hell out of china
and we all share the same love of almighty god
and we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true american way
and we drove her crazy
and we have a few guys that these are warriors
and we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers
and we will always live by the words of our national motto 
and we won and we won by a lot
and we're doing one other thing that believe it or not is even bigger but you'll be seeing that over the next two weeks
and we've all done a good job together
and what else
and with your help and your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working
and yes just won a big lawsuit last week
and you have a couple of people that are very very powerful
and you have a good governor
and you know one thing i have to say also and we're also winning the race to great great strategic defense and offense not just mars
and you know what
and you know what
and you know what he did
and you know what the sale price is
anyway but the guy was from her group
anywhere in the world
because i came here and they said 
because i not been doing that this long
because they didn't want this drug if it didn't work to hurt the people but the people were terminally ill
because they're not the smartest
because we're accomplishing so much
before i took office foreign countries ripped us off robbed us blind and pushed us around but america is not being pushed around anymore
big one for the security of israel
biggest beneficiary
bob
bob i'm worried about ohio
bob if we don't do great you're fired bob
bob paduchik
but a man who really has done a fantastic job he campaigned so hard and this was a star right from the fields of the great pocahontas whose now lying and cheating her way to the presidency if possible
but bob we just lost the head of the gop in ohio
but he had no choice and they had no choice
but here's the thing
but i appointed many more than him so let's take it that way
but i could do better
but i love it and you know why i love it
but i'll tell you what this is some crowd some turnout
but in lima and i said 
but only 2% come back
but our country didn't want to do it
but the good news is i don't use the teleprompter too much
but there never has been a movement like this
but there's tremendous potential to go up
but they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct
but they want to virtually and you know this they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder
but they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel and what was happening is united states steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and i stopped it
but think of it our ohio campaign with the best record the best results the best agenda and the only positive vision for our nation's future
but this movement is about your family and your future and it's about the life and the fate of your country
but we have so many things like that
but we're going to stay the way we have it
but we're now bigger than russia
but when you correct it you make yourself a little bit less popular
but yet again he was released back into your community
but you know why
by the time they see a doctor they're terminally ill
by the way they wouldn't have done that in primetime to our vets
by the way you know they keep talking about 
bye
can they sit on the stairs
can you believe it
catch and release we could end it immediately if the democrats caved
charter steel announced plans to build a new $150 million steel mill in cuyahoga heights and cleveland cliffs announced a new $700 million plant in a very good place that i like a lot toledo
china's paying for those tariffs
civil service
come
come on back to ohio
come on back to the united states
come on up
congratulations ohio
crooked hillary
deaths went down
democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents
democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion and they're the party frankly of socialism
democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves
democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream
deplorable was not a good day for hillary
do it
do it
do you realize that
do you remember the word deplorable
do you remember when hillary used the deplorable
do you see what's happening
do you think those people are going into a lottery
doctor
doctor in the house please
doing a great job
don't forget it's a hundred degrees in here
don't worry
don't worry about it sir
don't worry about it sir
doubled it
during the campaign i went to see it and they make the incredible the best army tank in the world and i couldn't believe the complexity the genius
either one
even a thing like right to try right
every day of my presidency we will never forget that we are americans and the future belongs to us
every place i go rob
every single democrat because they vote as a block
for 44 years they've been trying to get right to try
for a hundred years it's been one party control and look at them
for decades these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians and it's been total one party control of the inner cities
for the last 20 years china's taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country and now we're stopping the theft of american jobs
gee that's a good idea
george washington
give me a place
go to a private doctor
good i heard you did
good job
good job
good job mike
good job rob
great guy
great job
great job
great job

great support from the governor a different governor than mike by the way slightly
have you seen
he appointed 100% of the federal judges and 100% of the united states supreme court
he does a great job
he kept saying 
he left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave
he looked at the guy in front of him and he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he understands it
he wants to go back to sleep
he was at three and he went to 70
he was right
he was sharp as a tack and steve chabot and brad wenstrup and warren davidson and andy barr and a man named greg pence who happens to be a brother of somebody i know very well
he was sharp wasn't he
he's a friend of mine
he's been a great help
he's running in november and because i like him so much matt get a nice big arena ready we're going to do a rally for you
here are just a few examples
horrible crimes and murder
how about getting you to me like in about two hours
how about lotteries
how about that
how about the lottery system
how crazy is this
how crazy is this
how do you like that idea
how is it keith
how many do we have
i also want to introduce a friend of mine who's done an incredible job
i am the smartest guy to think of that
i believe it's higher than afghanistan in our country
i believe we'll check the numbers and if we're wrong they will tell us tomorrow
i came in we did a rally where we had people like this
i can tell you that
i could do better
i do believe the rate is higher than afghanistan yet democrats and they've run it for many years want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities
i don't know much about this guy but boy he's the most optimistic person i've ever met
i don't know sir but i can tell you one thing
i gave him a little reprieve
i got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives and a lot of help
i got that from working in ohio for two summers
i had a great life
i had experts and i said 
i have a great idea
i have a great idea
i have lists that go on for pages of things we've done
i have lists that you wouldn't even believe
i hear that office and i shudder ohio supreme court justices sharon kennedy and judy french
i heard this over and over for like a year and a half
i heard you did a great job
i hope he did a good job
i killed it
i like larry's tie
i love judges
i love this state
i put on a 25% tariff billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back
i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said to somebody 
i said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable but it turned out to be deplorable
i say 
i say 
i say it again
i say it all the time
i see it
i think he just went up
i think most of you must know this
i used to get great publicity
i want to tell you that
i was in vietnam and they said 
i was watching the so-called debate last night and i also watched the night before that was long long television
i withdraw our country from the job killing and very expensive paris climate accord
i wonder what happened to the cash
i wonder what they saw when those planes landed
i wonder why they forgot
i'd call him
i'd like to recuse myself because 29 years ago i met donald trump
i'd love to go to a rally
i'll give you a hint
i'll never forget a wonderful congressman from tennessee
i'll sign
i'm fighting for you each and every day
i'm going to a place called cincinnati ohio
i'm sorry
i'm starting to like mexico a lot
i've never seen it
i've never seen it
if a windmill is within two miles of your house your house is practically worthless
if i could go and buy the drugs from canada i could save 50%
if i did you would've been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal
if the rest of the country is voting like tennessee is voting you're going to win by a lot
if they had no money they'd just go home
if they were treating our vets badly you couldn't fire them for anything
if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor
if you like your plan you can keep your plan
in fact i think you just went up
in fact on of my lawyers for winning that lawsuit is here tonight
in god we trust
in lima
in san francisco an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft
in the bizarre worldview of the third and hard left they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent americans for a single politically incorrect thought
incredible
iran
iran
is this a great thing to do
it didn't work out well but get a suffer for a long time until i came along
it has to stop but they understand that
it takes them three four weeks sometimes to see a doctor
it was bad stuff and we didn't want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building
it was beautiful
it was complicated
it was good and it worked out well and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age and look what happened to all of us right
it was incredible
it was mixed up
it was packed the day before the election and mike dewine won that election
it was so easy
it would have destroyed manufacturing in this country and maybe that's what president obama meant when he said you can't produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the united states because he would've signed trans pacific partnership and he would've been right
it would have destroyed our automobile industry
it'll be headlines
it's a disgrace
it's a great great state and he has turned out to be a great great governor
it's a great thing
it's a shame the world is looking at it
it's a very unfair system
it's about time
it's about you
it's all they were talking about
it's an immigration system that's totally broken and we're going to win the house we're going to win the senate we're going to win the presidency and we're going to do a merit based immigration system
it's been a miracle
it's been amazing
it's been amazing with mitch and you and everybody
it's going to be amazing
it's great
it's great to be back in the state that i love
it's lima
it's not a good situation
it's not depleted anymore i can tell you that
it's rigged
it's that quality
it's the best it's ever done
it's the finest coal in the world
it's the only thing they do good
it's the only thing they have
it's time for democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch and release
it's tough enough and i want to thank by the way the country of mexico
ivanka trump

left together i put out a six minute video detailing everything i found unacceptable about liberalism and the democrat party
left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice trapping children and failing in government schools left and right
let's go see it
let's let them go outside
let's see what happens
let's see what happens there
let's try it
liberal politicians want to eliminate private dream
liberal politicians want to eliminate private healthcare and force everyone onto the government plan
like remember i used to scream when i was winning states and not getting the delegates that i was entitled to and i'd say the system is rigged
look at los angeles with the tents and the horrible horrible disgusting conditions
look at san francisco

my great wife the first lady melania she said 
my son donald jr
nationwide nearly eight million african-americans live in opportunity zones but every democrat voted against them
nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in america happen to live in the state of california
never been
never ever ever will it be a socialist country
never happened before
nice tie
no
no but think of that
no controversy
no economy is so strong
no good no good
no matter what label they use a vote for any democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of our great our beautiful our wonderful american dream
no one has paid a higher price for the far left's destructive agenda than americans living in our nation's inner cities
no sir
no we're doing good
no we're going to say with the great energy that's powering our businesses that's creating so many jobs
nobody else
nobody else could get it done
nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things we're doing
nobody talks about that
nobody would've thought that was possible
nobody writes that
not just ohio
now we say 
now we're going to bring it down by a lot

our country pays the highest prices in the world
our nation is stronger today than ever before
our pledge to america's workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 millions americans for the jobs of tomorrow
our shared republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs pro family pro growth and 100% pro american
our spirit is strong
our stride is back and our stand is clear
our tax plan also created nearly 9000 opportunity zones hottest thing going providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities
people could steal

republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans not criminal aliens
republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first
republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice but the greatest betrayal committed by the democrats is their support for open borders
republicans deliver jobs safety and opportunity for all americans

she said she was indian and i said that i have more indian blood than she does and i have none
she used deplorable and irredeemable right
she used two words
she went out and she had a blood test done and it came out 1024th
she's got over i think now 12 million people
she's really something she has been incredible as a leader of the gop
she's the chair and she's my friend jane timken
she's trying to win remember
she's working very hard
sir 
sir you're going to win ohio easily
so bob i had to pick campaign manager in ohio and i kept hearing from the media 
so he had to get out
so i got it approved and it wasn't easy
so i had to pick a campaign manager and i picked a man named bob paduchik
so i said 
so i went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and i said 
so if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from europe or from canada or from other places at a big deep discount we're doing it and we're giving them the right to do it
so many of these mayors right now you know where they are
so many people have done so well
so percentage wise nobody's ever seen anything like it
so they got to vote on the usmca
so they'll sign an agreement very strong one page taking all liability away from the united states from the drug companies from the doctors all liability
so we have a great governor in the state of florida ron desantis calls me up
so we're going to be up to within two months 179 federal judges
so what we're doing is something else
so you got a lot of hot people outside but we broke the all time record

thanks to steel tariffs hundreds of thousands of tons think of this were dumped on our shores and steel is like something else
that didn't work out too well but you had a suffer
that means 401ks
that means job
that person's been standing there for almost a day if you think about it
that was a beauty
that wasn't pretty
that's a good idea
that's a good thing not a bad thing
that's a pretty good increase right
that's all there
that's another one
that's in two and a half years
that's mexico and canada
that's one record we're not going to beat
that's people that are really sick terminally ill
that's the only thing they have going
that's the way it works that's the way it works i guess
that's the way we should be doing it
that's what he did
that's what they did
that's what we should be doing
that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
the conditions in nancy pelosi's once great city of san francisco are deplorable
the country isn't based on that the country you just take a look look at the people they put into these lotteries
the country puts the name in a basket and you picked people out of the lottery
the democrat party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear
the democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay
the democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence
the democrats spent more time attacking barack obama than they did attacking me practically
the doctors didn't want to do it
the era of economic surrender is over and when you look at what they've done to your jobs over a period of time nafta was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worst deal
the future belongs to all of you
the future belongs to the greatest movement in the history of our country
the government didn't want to do it
the guy says afghanistan
the homicide rate in baltimore is significantly higher than el salvador honduras guatemala
the insurance companies didn't want to do it
the job of elected officials is to represent american citizens the radical democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets
the number one economy on earth
the numbers are good
the numbers are good keith
the previous administration they liked to windmills
the previous administration tried to shut down american energy and close up totally close it up
the republican party is the party of freedom
the soviet union when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves russia
the very next month the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe a horrible thing happened
their policies no good
then it became russia and you know what
then we lost a couple of other people
then you wonder why so many people are coming up
there were a lot of you
there's never been a movement like this
there's never been anything like it
there's never been anything like it
there's never been anything like it
there's never been anything right
there's no tariff
there's no tariff
there's only one person
these lines for the veterans are too long
these open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals drain public services and flood communities with poisonous drugs
they are not the smartest
they been trying to pass va choice for four decades
they both have
they break down all the time
they can be whatever they want
they can't breathe
they can't breathe aw
they choke like dogs
they could be sadistic to our vets
they couldn't get anything
they couldn't get it done
they couldn't get medicine
they did well in the state
they do a lot more for us than the democrats do right
they don't want them
they don't want to talk about that
they forgot
they gave a grilling
they give you everything they can give you except voter id and the things that matter
they had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction
they had no hope
they have been with us through thick and thin and it has been mostly really good times because what we've done no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done
they have early voting and one of the earliest places great state tennessee and he was in pennsylvania with me great state
they have paid a dear price
they have trump banners and trump hats and trump buttons
they kept it open and now we're making army tanks around the clock
they kill your birds
they make noise they're intermittent
they pour money into their system they pour it in and because they do that you're not paying for those tariffs
they put foreign citizens before american citizens
they said 
they said 
they said 
they say to sleepy joe
they show me the things we're doing in our country today
they steal our intellectual property
they stick together
they took it off to list
they traveled to europe
they want all sorts of security
they were all over
they were dumping garbage they call it sand steel they call it dirt steel
they weren't expanding or they weren't building
they would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the united states like they've been doing for the last 25 years
they'd been working in this few years
they'd die
they'd travel all over the world hoping for a cure
they'd traveled to asia if they had money
they'll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately
they'll come back
they'll get a little something and they'll come right back because there's never been anything like this
they're coming up because we're the hottest economic country in the world but they're also coming up because you have people like that governor say 
they're dangerous and not good
they're deplorable
they're happy
they're in jail that's where they are
they're lousy politicians but they stick together like glue
they're praying
they're teaching them the great companies of our country they're teaching people how to do it and it's an incredible thing to watch
they're terminally ill
they're the ones we don't want to have come back
they've been trying to get that for years and years and years
they've done a good job with energy and so has saudi arabia done a good job with energy
they've got 21000 soldiers on the border right now
they've got a lot of problems
they've had movements
they've never seen anything like this before
they've squeezed the blood out of them
think of that
think of that
think of that
think of that number
think of this
this great congressman said 
this is a movement the likes of which they've never seen before maybe anywhere but certainly in this country
this is complicated
this is genius and you'll never replace these men and women that work here
this is where a veteran would stand online for three four five six days for three weeks for five weeks
this isn't like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof
this morning that's all the fake news was talking about
this one another murder
this one i better not say
this one robbed four banks
this one's a murderer
this was chuck schumer
this was during the campaign
this was unthinkable because four years ago steel plans were closing
to give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could've passed except us
to protect america's security i withdrew the united states from the horrible iran nuclear deal a horrible stupid deal
to vietnam

again it's not the same
aids
alfred e
all of a sudden people started watching and looking and i was proud to hold his first event
all of the radical democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth
all right make it 20
all right that's time
all right that's time magazine
all those beautiful mountains and rivers and lakes he's the guy
also something we got that people don't talk about if you love your children you don't have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses
although actually i do like the new owner
although i have been helping you out
although mike bloomberg said you'll never figure it out
america lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the wto
america's thriving like never before and ladies and gentlemen of colorado the best is yet to come
and a lot of these kids are very strong physically
and actually i have to say this
and all he does is watch sporting events and big ones
and by the way corey was with us all the way
and by the way i did something for air force but i did something for all of the academies
and by the way i told them turn around not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because it's fake news
and congressman doug lamborn
and don't believe stories and don't believe polls because the polls are worse than the stories
and for those of you that want to hear it when they're making them more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone the atmosphere
and for women 71 years and soon you're going to be hitting the historic number
and he has been my friend for a long time
and he put this woman on today and she said 
and he's got my complete and total support and endorsement
and he's interviewed by somebody
and here's the final one and i could get you another 15
and i also took the strongest ever action to confront china's massive theft of american jobs
and i don't know if anybody watched last night's debate it got very big ratings and you know what
and i know the women out there are saying 
and i mentioned him a little earlier but you didn't know he was here
and i said 
and i said 
and i shook 1156 hands
and i think they have a rule after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year
and i will be making a big decision for the space force as to where it's going to be located and i know you want it
and i'm not saying anything can ever compete with 2016 but i think if we don't do it a lot of what we've done and we're going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we've done for the vets with choice and accountability but you know what
and i'm saying this in front of the fake news because if i'm wrong they're going to report me right
and i've got this woman
and it was unbelievable
and judge jeanine and even greg gutfeld
and kimberly guilfoyle
and marco came in third and a guy who i don't like much and they don't like him much in ohio either kasich
and mrs
and now they call it person of the year
and ran good poll
and she said 
and she said to me she said 
and the general said sir would you like to shake hands with the cadets
and the people that bought it said we're not buying it unless dana white stays back and runs it
and the place went crazy because i was the only one telling the truth
and then he said a few nights ago 
and then i said wait a minute
and then i turn on the damn show on fox
and then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff because that's dangerous in this room to be honest
and then this stupid person said i didn't debate well
and then you have brad pitt
and they agreed to do it
and they come up and they're strong people
and they don't say this but after a period of time they get tired they get old they get rusty and a lot of the guys say hey their useful life is gone
and they just sold the company
and they put together a phenomenal deal it's called ufc
and they're all made in china and in germany
and they're good kids and maybe they'll never be you
and they're shaking and they're excited
and this is part of the swamp
and we are going to be making that decision cory when we make that decision all right
and we are taking the bureau of land management out of washington dc
and we created into that military that we talked about and we created something that's very exciting
and we did it
and we have ended the war on american energy
and we have in the morning fox and friends steve and ainsley and brian's gotten much better he's moving up
and we have our great new general
and we have the great lou dobbs
and we just killed the world's number one terrorist qasen soleimani ending his evil reign of terror forever
and we sent them polls poll after poll after poll
and we're also joined tonight by somebody that you really love and i love him too but there's a reason
and we've rebuilt our military over the last three years
and you don't have to serve
and you don't hear from other people
and you have all of the infrastructure so you're being very strongly considered for the space command
and you have warriors
and you know what
and you know what
and you're going to help us get cory gardner across that line because he's been with us 100%
and you've got hegseth and you've got jesse waters
and your second amendment is at stake remember that
another place peterson air force base you know that
another place the air force academy you know that and schriever right air force base schriever
anyway but we're doing what
are you accusing me of being dumb
are you listening donnie
are you listening donnie
are you saying i'm dumb
as a result of state and local sanctuary policies officials in boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community
as you know and by the way that's a record by a lot
at stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation
beautiful place beneath the majestic peaks that's true of the rocky mountains with thousands of terrific hardworking great american patriots
because america is truly a land of heroes on behalf of the grateful nation i would like to recognize the many veterans of the vietnam war and the iraq and afghanistan wars who are here this evening and a lot of them
because last night i think we turned away 21000 people
because she was referring to mike bloomberg sometimes referred to as mini mike
because that's really what he was doing but he doesn't want to say that
becky's like she plays it a little bit down in the middle right
believe me we like the environment more than anybody
ben carson good man he was down
big deal
billion
billions of dollars poured into the united states
blow wind please
border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded
bring those pages up
build a bigger stadium
but a lot of the women out there don't like it
but as we keep on winning washington democrats keep on losing their minds
but can you imagine that
but colorado voters will never let it happen
but everybody knows neil cavuto
but he walked in he's smart and he said 
but i hear they're going to have 10 million people they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world the largest cricket stadium in the world which is brand new and beautiful
but i love that group of people
but i love the air force academy
but i remember holding up the new york times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain a supermarket right
but i said 
but i think things are happening
but i'll tell you what my wife said 
but if somebody up there does something those cameras turn around spin around like a pretzel
but it was only 16 people
but it's a lot different under trump isn't it
but it's easy to be presidential
but it's going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the usa
but it's okay we'll win anyway
but look at all that press
but look at these numbers
but now he says 
but see at least we have a voice where we can explain
but she said i didn't do well on the bench
but she's third rate and she's on the lowest rated show at fox neil cavuto
but since the election 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we've invested more than $2 trillion into that military that we talked about
but then they said 
but they don't do 1156
but they had alfred e
but they never show the room
but this woman who is a third rate fourth rate she's been with everybody
but under this administration all of that is changing
but very close
but we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren't taking care of our vets
but we have secretary david bernhardt department of interior

but we've destroyed the isis territorial caliphate 100 percent

but when it comes to our military and our safety and our security we don't worry about budgets right
but when the world evolves around all of us we should be chosen
but when we leave it's all of us
but while they're doing that stuff and we're working with a cloud we're working with these people

i think i can say this mr
i told the story that a month before i ran 2016 i was thinking about it
i took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover but think of it
i turn on fox and i've got this third rate political journalist if you call her that saying 
i used to think well it's the equipment it's very rigid
i want to find out what's going on

i'm looking at that sucker
i'm not going to mention it
i'm not leaving him
i'm not worried about it
i'm saying 
i'm the only one i guess that raised the hand
i'm the only who said take it
i've always said i could be more presidential than anybody but i'm not sure i can beat honest abe when he wears the hat
i've got to do it right otherwise they'll say what's wrong
i've had people say 
i've never done it
i've spent a lot of time here over the years
i've told it a couple of times
if i didn't do good you'd dump me so fast
if i do it that's a bad sign
if she said 
if somebody isn't doing a good job you couldn't fire him
if they don't treat you well give don't leave them a damn thing
if they're 40 years old if they're 45 years old they can be there for 40 50 years
if we have 10 million people in india how can i be satisfied if we fill up a 60000 seat stadium
if you don't love them don't leave that beautiful farm to your children
if you go 16 of these and if you mispronounce one word they say what's wrong
if you love your children it's great and if you don't love your children don't worry about it
if you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states if you want to protect your family and your loved ones you must vote for cory vote for trump vote for the republican party
if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november of 2020 november 3rd
illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release
impeach obama
in communities across the nation radical and we're watching them very closely left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities and sanctuary states and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities
in denver an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times attempting to murder him his own home
in denver officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges and now he is a very dangerous man
in fact you have one of them as an example he was the winner of the home run derby
in my state of the union address i proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great american comeback
in the old days it was better for us
incredible deal
isn't that great
isn't that great
isn't that nice
it absolutely makes sense
it actually plays to their advantage
it looks like crazy bernie
it really was
it should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then
it took me a little while
it was a lie
it was a rough one
it was a war and we're up here and we're doing it
it was better for us
it was blown down
it was dead and now it's successful again
it was depleted
it was different
it was great
it was in bad shape
it was much better
it was much better
it was old it was tired
it was on fire
it was totally fiction
it will be solid
it's a 10 year process
it's a record and we're going up
it's a serious wall
it's all about getting it done
it's all right
it's been amazing
it's full
it's going to look like peanuts from now on
it's gone up 122 miles as of yesterday
it's got to be buttoned up
it's great
it's great to be in vermont
it's great to be with the great people of ohio
it's hard to be friends when you're competing against somebody
it's horrible what's happening the largest amount ever recorded
it's like i said the last time nobody's leading trump in texas
it's like the thing was blowing in the wind
it's not easy mike
it's not so easy up there to do what i did right
it's over
it's partially desert
it's so disgusting
it's so easy
it's so easy honestly
it's so easy to be presidential so easy
it's so great to be with the people of colorado
it's so much easier than doing what i have to do but you know what i'd have
it's such fake news
it's true
it's true
it's true
jeez
jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in colorado

newman buttigieg little buttigieg

remember president obama 28 times he said 
republicans are fighting for school choice big deal it's a big deal because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school
republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background every community and every walk of life
republicans believe that colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans not criminal aliens

that beautiful phrase
that hat is too much
that includes them all
that is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime
that is why at my state of the union i asked congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
that means that if you're a great athlete you can go to the air force academy or army navy the coast guard you can go to one of our service academies
that should be worse
that was beautiful because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time
that was the end of her campaign in my book

that's why millions of registered democrats voters people that were with the democrats for a long time they're leaving their party to join our movement
the alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years
the best ever
the border is going to be very soon secured
the cameras glong on to those seats they glong on and they say 
the college home run derby
the democrat party is the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total obliteration of your second amendment
the democrats are thrilled about that one and as you know i have nominated and we have confirmed two great new supreme court justices colorado zone right
the easiest thing you could do is presidential
the era of economic surrender is over thank you
the great dan scavino the most powerful man in politics
the great lou dobbs
the great lou dobbs
the next day he'll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing
the next one was 13%
the next one was 5% 4% 3% 2% 2% 2% 1% 1% and 0
the numbers are staggering
the polls have closed in the great state of texas
the president is leading him by 20 points
the presidents don't do that
the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and the late great abraham lincoln
the rest i'm not going to talk about but he hasn't been exactly a great supporter sort of a never trumper i guess
the sixth branch of the united states armed forces the space force
the unemployment rate among african-americans hispanic-americans and asian-americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded
the usmca is a gigantic victory for farmers ranchers and manufacturers all across the great state of colorado and every other state

then they have all the rest of them
there was no waiver
there was no waiver with corey
there were 10 women and the one woman beautiful incredible women and they had their bandanas they had hats trump and stupid cnn they go up 
there were two empty seats
there's nothing wrong with it right
there's things that i can tell you about the president of the united states that you don't hear on t
there's trouble those same guys could it could cover anything
these are all the ones that taken right after
these are the democrats
these are the worst people
these are very very dishonest people but you know that
these are your democrats
these fakers back there they don't want people
these people
they agreed to it

142
5 billion of countries that were taking taking advantage of us

a lot of water dump
a man i saw on television last night defending me brilliantly defending me
a person who's been an incredible ally again loves your state randy weber
about you
above all we will never stop fighting for the values that unite people all across our land and throughout the great state of texas
abraham lincoln could not win texas under those circumstances
abraham lincoln honest abe couldn't do it louie right
actually sir the number is 142
after birth
all he had to do is look at the tape or look at what they wrote down the transcribed version of the phone call
all of a sudden i'm supposed to be debating tomorrow night
all you have to do is act like a stiff look
almost all of them ran for president of the class
although the fake news back there they don't want to talk about it
america is winning again and america is respected again
american combat troops should not be at the center of ancient sectarian conflicts all over the world
among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are millions of legal immigrants right here in texas including millions of patriotic hardworking mexican-americans who play by the rules pay their taxes follow our laws and strengthen our communities
and a friend of mine he's another one
and a great governor from your state he's a great great man and a friend of mine
and a lot of good things are happening
and african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels in history
and after years of stagnation wages for hispanic americans are rising fast up nearly eight percent since my election and everybody in the fake news would have said that's absolutely impossible
and as you all know i guess you've been watching today
and because you're a developing nation ted right
and by the way he did even better percentage-wise in judges than i did
and by the way i have to say this so outside they have close to 30000 people
and by the way ice is fantastic
and by the way our great first lady is home watching this
and by the way the democrats want open borders
and everybody thought these people thought that was strange
and everyone's saying 
and finally i get a call
and frankly if they're not i'm not going to introduce them okay
and he goes 
and he had a great victory against a man that spent almost $100 million dollars
and he had mueller and everybody figured out long before anybody else had it figured out right louie
and he was literally i mean national debate he was the best in all of college and in law school
and he's a man of god
and he's a talented guy
and he's going to be leaving at the end of the year and probably coming back here
and i called ivanka i called my kids i said 
and i came here we had rallies like this
and i had guys on from texas and they're wearing cowboy hats
and i had many more than he had
and i have to say this we are far greater now than ever before
and i hired a debate coach and he lasted for about 10 minutes
and i know it from personal experience
and i love donald trump
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i said oh the great thing
and i thought this wacko was kidding
and i told this story i was embarrassed to tell it but now i'll tell when i first got in a general told me we could've had a conflict with someone said 
and i won
and i wonder if i could ask the fire marshal fill up this little area let them in it would be so nice
and i'm going to say yes you can
and if it's not even just like so close it takes a long time
and it has absolutely no respect for the will of the american people
and it was ronna and she's done a fantastic job
and it was ronna and we won the state of michigan we won
and it was vicious and now we love each other again
and it's a great tribute to a lot of very talented people and thank you to vice president pence and thank you to mike pompeo
and it's all about the future fate of our great country
and lance gooden special person lance gooden thank you lance
and lance was one of 60 people that stuck in there he was unbelievable
and let me tell you it if my crooked opponent would have won the election right now china would be by far the number one nation from an economic standpoint in the world
and many of them are bad people
and many of them are built right here right here
and now they continue the outrageous impeachment witch hunt with nothing
and now we've made deals with guatemala and honduras and el salvador and mexico
and once we do it's going to be very hard to take this beautiful experiment apart
and our great campaign manager the most sophisticated man with a computer you've ever seen
and our relationship with china is fantastic and great things are happening
and remember she spent like six times more on this stuff than we did
and rick perry couldn't have done a better job truly truly
and ron wright thank you ron
and secretary of commerce one of the legends of wall street he was really like amazing and he is doing an incredible job wilbur ross
and she was in charge of michigan and i said 
and shifty schiff
and ted ted was tough
and that crackpot governor from virginia executes the baby after birth
and that is why i have imposed and we had passed and we won at the united states supreme court a travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries and places
and that's why 2016 was so important
and that's why 2020 i can never say it's more important but you know it's like the roots of a tree
and that's with no help from the democrats
and the guest goes 
and the kurds who are our friends and turkey's our friend
and the previous administration spent no money on that and we're spending a lot
and the two of them call me
and the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world world
and the usmca is a giant victory for texas farmers ranchers manufacturers workers and oil
and then 
and then biden flew
and then i had ted cruz on my back and i had john cornyn on my back and i had the congressman calling and it was brutal it wasn't even fair
and then the piggy bank is gone where they all rob from
and then we are getting them out of the country
and then when i won the election we had the greatest night one of the highest rated nights in the history of television all over the world
and they go into our country
and they said 
and they would have come through and they said 
and they wouldn't get rid of the loopholes
and they're going to go out and they get to take in 50 billion from china as opposed to 20
and they're going to say no we can't
and to protect american security i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal
and together we are taking back this country our country
and together we will make america wealthy again
and together with your lieutenant governor dan patrick
and turkey's all set and president erdogan one was great and we're going to take the worst sanctions and tariffs and everything that i put on the country we put the worst i mean i don't think they could have economically survived but that doesn't matter
and we also recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
and we didn't win any cases at the wto and now we just won $7
and we had 17 people plus me
and we have a lot of congress people here
and we have to get this crazy nancy pelosi to put this thing up for a vote
and we lose for many years $500 billion a year with china and many other countries we lose billions
and we must show and vote and we have to go out and we have to win this election coming up
and we never lose
and we went there and we said we want to pause and the kurds have been terrific
and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions
and we will make america great again
and we won by a lot
and we won florida and we won south carolina and we won georgia and we won north carolina and we won pennsylvania
and we'll have a record number of judges by the time our term is over in 16 years maybe 20
and we're building the wall and we're doing all of these things but the democrats won't close up the loopholes
and we're focusing on the bad and they're getting the hell out of our country
and we've won a lot of cases lately
and what about the whistleblower
and when it came time when it came time to picking somebody to head the rnc republican national committee i said 
and when it does it's going to be vicious
and when it was sort of over there was nobody more gracious and i called him i made him secretary of energy he's done a phenomenal job
and who is the ig that did this
and you know five years ago almost every one of them wanted a wall until i came along and i said we're going to build a great wall because they could never get it done
and you know he's never leaving
and you know that's what's been happening
and you know the way they sell it and it's so good they're salesman they're incredible salesman
and you know what
and you know what
and you know what happened
and you know what he'd rather have that too actually right
and you see it all the time and i've never seen it to this extent
and you're going oh no don't tell me
andrew jackson they say ours topped andrew jackson
another man who's currently running against somebody
anything we do the democrats will criticize
are they any good at debating
as an example we're building a great wall along the southern border and it's going up rapidly
as president i will never allow the democrats to take away your healthcare dollars and give them to people that are in our country illegally
as we restore our security we're also restoring our prosperity
at stake in this fight is their survival of american democracy itself
because it's all about your family
because the democrats and the fake news media it's a partnership
because they came after us
because they know i'll leave if they don't treat us fairly
because we really like each other
billions and billions and billions
boy he hit me during the campaign
bring our soldiers back home
bring our soldiers back home
but a man and john i have no idea who you're running against but nobody's going to be able to beat john cornyn
but andrew jackson was a good election
but brad parscale did a great job
but did you see the other night where cnn in a totally unsubstantiated statement the president said this about you
but he said 
but he spent three years with us and i want to thank you rick what a job you done thank you
but i don't think joe has a chance
but i said 
but i went there and i went there a lot
but if democrats seize power they would throw the floodgates wide open wide open
but it is true
but it is what it is
but it kept going in and out water water
but it was a terrific thing and we've taken care of a lot of religious persecution
but it was unconventional but they fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious
but it's going to be very tough for these people ever to get back
but joe biden was in charge of ukraine policy while his son with absolutely no energy experience just got thrown out of the navy like a dog was paid massive sums of money by a ukrainian energy company
but john cornyn is not talking about beto anymore because beto in a few short weeks got rid of guns and got rid of religion
but look at all those cameras
but maybe soon that will start
but much more
but nancy has to put it up for a vote
but no matter how hard they try they will fail because the people of texas and the people of america will never surrender our freedom to those people right there
but now we send them back
but now we're taking in billions of dollars
but said i've never seen anyone hand out so many subpoenas
but slowly they're getting out
but that was easy
but that's all changing now
but the do nothing democrats believe anyone who opposes them has to be crushed
but the farmers i call them the great patriots the farmers
but the more america achieves the more hateful and enraged these crazy democrats become
but their partner in the whole thing is the fake news media
but they don't want to show the tape
but they fought it was tougher
but they give me the first card ted cruz and it says 
but they give this
but they said texas they said texas is in play
but they were great
but think of that
but this should have been done many many years ago by other presidents and other leaders
but those guys right there and me we got it done
but we came out okay ted
but we could have 50%
but we did great
but we had 18 people
but we had among the greatest elections of all time
but we have some great leaders and you have great leaders in texas
but we have to now cement that election
but we lose 500 billion not million
but we're finally again putting america first
but we're talking about them
but we've made deals now where we can bring back there are 45000 people waiting in mexico
but you know what
but you look at that
but you're not being treated badly anymore
by the way that was after a few weeks ago
by the way the democrats want to raise your taxes you know
can you believe it
can you believe we've been doing this for three years
can you imagine
can't do it
come and take it
compare that to the whistle blower's account and you see it had nothing to do with it
congratulations on what you've done
could you come to my rally
could you give us your address
could you give us your address
could you please give us your address and your name
could you please give us your name and phone number
couldn't do it couldn't do it ted
couldn't do it louis
crazy
crazy nancy
dan dan patrick
darling i want to watch trump speak tonight
democrats are now the party of crazy politicians high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
disgrace

do you think trump's going to be able to debate professionally
do-nothing democrats
doesn't like us at all
doing a great job
don't kid yourself

i am thrilled to be here deep in the heart of texas where we just opened a beautiful new louie vuitton plant
i blame our leaders for allowing this horrible you know what and pillage
i called him right
i came from a small town alvarado texas where we celebrated the incredible revival of american manufacturing and we opened up some beautiful places
i can tell you that and texas is not in play
i can't believe that
i contributed to a lot of them
i don't actually mean that
i don't believe it
i don't blame china by the way
i don't know
i don't know about you but i know something about texas and donald trump is not going to lose texas
i don't know if you've seen it
i don't know when i had to compete with ted cruz that was brutal
i don't like it
i don't mean a little bit
i don't mean a little bit
i don't see it
i don't think he's got it
i don't think so
i don't think the guy's got a chance
i don't want to use it because they'll say it's a horrible word that trump used
i get a call from the governor and dan is there
i got a problem
i got a problem
i got one
i guess george washington was good right
i had 35 farmers in the oval office
i had to put it up on my social media site
i hate to say it
i hate to talk about him
i have all these congressmen over here
i have none
i have people getting subpoenas i never heard of
i heard a commentator who happens to be standing right there the other day
i just said thanks
i kept thinking maybe beto will jump in because he's at zero right now
i know a lot of them
i liked honest abe
i liked playing baseball better
i love it
i love maine but maine too you get one
i love seeing it
i love that guy
i mean how is that good
i mean i get that too
i mean it was nasty and you couldn't make a deal for 15 think of it for 15 years 20 years they couldn't make a deal
i mean like double them up triple them up and it's still won't pay for the nonsense they want
i mean we've done a good job
i need help
i never debated
i never did
i never did that before right
i never lost them
i never thought i'd be called a politician
i noticed it
i paid billions and billions of dollars to the state
i ran for office
i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said no it's not a subsidy
i said nope no good
i said tell them to go out and get bigger tractors right
i said to ivanka i said to the first lady i said to anybody that would listen i said listen this is so great
i said who are those people
i said why is this guy hot
i sent vice president pence and secretary of state pompeo to lead an american delegation to meet with president erdogan of turkey
i think that's not good
i think the biggest dump of water remember kept going in and out in and out
i think they want to go to windmills windmills you know
i thought he was kidding
i took a lot of heat even from some of our congressman even from some of our senators but now they're all happy and i'm happy with them
i want 50 billion not 20 billion
i want the farmers to say
i want the farmers to say sir we just can't produce that much product
i want to get him before congress and i want to see what he has to say
i want to see it
i want you to do me a favor
i went to 21 states
i will never allow the federal government to be used to punish americans for their religious beliefs
i will never allow the irs to be used as a political weapon except in the case of myself where they use it against me
i will tell you that
i won't say anything bad about your network because a lot of times i get ready to do a number of these phony networks and you know you see those red lights go off off off off
i'd go to four states and relax
i'd like him to
i'd like him to
i'd rather have that
i'd say honest abe that was a pretty good election right
i'll tell you once we got him on board he wouldn't leave us no matter what
i'll tell you this place is doing great and created in a very short period of time an extra 1000 jobs for texas
i'm doing this for you
i'm fighting for everyone who believes in the values traditions and principles that have made our nation the greatest in the history of the world
i'm going to a debate
i'm going to be debating in front of millions of people
i'm going to say yes you can
i'm going to say you're legitimate media
i'm happy with them
i'm not going to say it tonight
i'm only kidding
i'm only kidding because every time i do that they say 
i'm supposed to be happy
i'm telling you
i'm with the freedom loving patriots of the lone star state
i've always said i can be more presidential than any president in history except for honest abe lincoln when he's wearing the hat
i've been a politician for three years
i've got these great brilliant senators over here
if i said like on the china deal 
if i were a democrat i wouldn't be too happy about that number
if they didn't hate our country they wouldn't be doing this to our country
in everything we do we're fighting for the faithful citizens of this country
in fact i just signed an executive action to protect american healthcare benefits for all american citizens
in fact when ted cruz held a rally in washington he said 
in other words they want to annihilate your texas economy
in recent debates did you see these debates
in that example nobody would've ever done that
in the meantime we've taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs and china's eaten the cost because they devalued their currency and they put money out
incredible people
is he here
is that right
is the whistleblower a spy
it accepts no compromise
it doesn't play well because it was perfect
it failed because they had stupid people saying horrible things about us
it just doesn't work with them
it permits no opposition
it was a big one it was a bad one
it was a disgrace
it was actually not 17 it was 18
it would have been so much easier right
it's a different form
it's a disgrace that that was allowed to go on for 25 years
it's a disgrace what they're doing to our country
it's a subsidy
it's all about your future
it's also the party of honest abe lincoln
it's called a payoff folks
it's cost us nothing
it's cut in half
it's going to be a landslide and we have to make it a landslide
it's great to be with you tonight
it's impossible
it's incredible
it's level like this
it's not happening
it's not happening anymore
it's not just like let's win
it's only $10 billion
it's really pretty simple
it's the r word
it's too much
it's true
joe biden made them go out and fire the prosecutor on tape

ladies and gentlemen the polls have closed in the state of texas
last month unemployment reached its lowest level in 51 years
last week a very dumb democrat candidate for president that's the end of him in this state pledged to revoke the tax exempt status of many churches and religious charities

not even close
not so nice when i was their opponent that changed a lot
now i don't know what about the democrats
now it looks like she's doing better
now it's really working out for a lot of different groups
now that's what you call quid pro quo
now we have so much ammunition we don't know what to do with it
now we've won a lot of cases
now you have a president who's standing up for america and standing up for your great state of texas
nowhere is the democrat betrayal of our nation more dramatic than on immigration
oh and i think he's like pretty light on oil production too
oh i'm so sorry
oh isn't that wonderful
oh let's see could we give texas an extra 10 billion for some crazy thing that may work and it may not right
okay
okay
okay coach
one by one
one guy was a good debater in college
one of the best lawyers you'll ever find
only american tractors

sir we want one more small request just a small it's not much and we appreciate your listening to us
sir you have 142 federal judges
sleepy joe
smart as hell and tough
smart guy
so biden flew with hunter on air force 2
so biden takes 1500000000 and he goes on and he allows china to rip us off
so he made up a totally false conversation with the ukrainian president and we caught him cold
so here we have a few people right
so i got to i say 
so i guess you got to give george washington what do you think ted you got to give him something
so i see 
so important
so my guys say sir we have a problem sir
so now china's agreed
so now i gave them a field that's more than level
so now we're doing a five day period we're going to see if we can get it all finalized and i think it will be i think it will be
so that's good
so the biden's got rich while america got robbed
so they go 
so they wanted 20 in china agreed
so turkey's going to be happy
so we have to fundamentally change our approach to homeland security as an example
so we spent much less then hillary crooked hillary crooked hillary
so when i got in always when you get in there are none
so why does the ig allow a thing like this to happen to our country
some are unbelievably dangerous and bad people
some are very good people
some of these guys are okay
sometimes dictators they just don't like to go by that title
sometimes you have to let them fight a little while
sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids in a lot
spent almost $100 million but that was a great victory
stupid
stupid people
subpoena
ted cruz
ted cruz was the national debate he was the number one guy in college
tens of billions of dollars
tens of thousands more have been severely wounded and in all fairness the other side has lost millions of people
texas

thank you tommy
thank you very much
thank you very much brian babin
thank you wilbur
that crazy nancy
that doesn't work well with me
that guy's ruthless
that was a great defense i appreciate it
that would mean that president obama didn't appoint 142 judges
that'll be very hard
that's a lot
that's a lot
that's a lot of money
that's a real beauty
that's a tough one to beat
that's good
that's impossible
that's in about four weeks
that's not bad
that's not what it's about
that's okay
that's the beautiful thing about the electoral college you go everywhere
that's the problem
that's tough that's tough
that's what they want
that's what we've done
that's what's going to happen
that's what's going to happen
that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
that's why it failed
the anger the hatred and that any lie or crime or corruption is justified so schiff gets up and makes up my statement
the democrats even want it and crazy nancy won't let anybody vote on it
the democrats should pass it overwhelmingly
the democrats will say 
the do nothing democrats have betrayed our country and that great betrayal is over
the economy is booming
the farmers said sir we don't want this money
the first card i looked at seriously it was ted cruz
the flailer
the hell i don't know all of them
the kurds are going to be happy isis is going to be unhappy
the kurds didn't want to move
the most china ever did was 16 billion for our farmers
the most they ever did was 20 billion of product from our farmers
the only message these radicals and they are radical lefties will understand is a crushing defeat on november 3rd 2020
the press will not talk about it
the radical democrats want to destroy america as we know it
the radical left tolerates no dissent
the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and it's the party of the american dream
the republicans said i'm not sure i like this because my life hasn't been this way but the republicans play a much softer game
the same people pushing us to fight endless wars overseas want us to open our borders to mass migration from these war torn and terror afflicted regions
the state of texas john cornyn and ted cruz they're going to come into my office
the texas polls have closed and usually if it's close it takes hours
the whistleblower got it all wrong
the whole country now is doing a great job
their policies would import terrorism right onto our shores with american issued visas
then after she lost they said trump's campaign was so sophisticated
then it was the smearing which continues that disgraceful disgusting smearing of a fine man justice kavanaugh
then people find out how tough the fighting is
then they stopped the funding
there has never been a better time to be a proud texan and there's never a better time to be a proud american
there never has
there's no problem
these are great people
these are great people along with republican party chairs and all of these total winners
these are sick people
these are the fake newsers out there
these characters back there said oh that's okay
these courageous texas patriots did not shed their blood sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy demolish our liberty and destroy our proud american heritage
these guys know right up here these guys know right
these people are crazy
these wars brought mass chaos instability destruction and death
these were not the same chinese people i just dealt with
they all said you couldn't win michigan
they all want our money
they always said yeah i'm in trouble
they are all wonderful people
they are corrupt people
they are destroying this country but we will never let it happen
they are stupid people and their ratings have dropped like a rocket
they are wonderful people
they believe america is the world's piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy military and defense of every other nation in the world but our own
they can't
they cannot pass it and they cannot win it at the ballot box
they come after me but what they're really doing is they're coming after the republican party and what they're really really doing is they're coming after and fighting you
they come home mommy daddy this is what i learned
they consider china a developing nation
they couldn't get it done
they didn't want it
they don't have a phone
they don't stop
they don't want their viewers to see it but that's okay
they don't want to have an address that's in honduras
they don't want to have that have a phone
they don't want to just beat him
they don't want to just beat them
they don't want to show the tape where he was bragging
they don't want to talk about it
they flew to china
they get it
they get it now
they go 
they go on forever
they got there today and it did work
they got worse
they have all sorts of protections
they hired him paying him massive amounts of money much more than the $50000 a month you heard about
they just flooded
they know better
they know it
they know it
they know it
they love your state
they loved their families they loved their country and they loved their god
they made a fortune
they made it almost impossible
they may find them
they may find those 33000 emails
they never left me
they never pay
they never pay the price
they never thought i'd released the conversation with the ukrainian president
they really do
they said 
they said he cannot get to 270 and they were right
they said no sir it's a subsidy
they said sir just give us a level field
they said sir they can't produce $50 billion
they said those jobs had disappeared didn't they
they said to me 
they said you'd toss in play too
they say 
they say because it's voting it's suppression
they say it's only 10 billion
they say let's see
they say sir congratulations sir on what you've done
they still keep calling me for money
they stuck with us through thick and thin
they try and get your hopes down
they used to treat me very nice when i contributed to them
they want everybody to flow in
they want those caravans to flow in the caravans
they want to crush these people
they want to disarm law abiding citizens
they want to give more to illegal aliens than they give to american citizens
they want to indoctrinate our children and teach them that america is a sinful wicked nation
they want to install far left judges to shred our constitution
they want to oppose an extreme agenda
they want to silence your voices on social media and they want the government to censor muzzle and shut down conservative voices
they want to take your guns away
they want to tear down symbols of faith and drive christians and religious believers from the public square
they want windmills
they were only president of the class
they will
they won't close the loopholes and we could do it in 15 minutes
they won't close up the loopholes
they would say 
they wouldn't be doing it because they know better
they're corrupt like schiff is corrupt
they're crazy
they're crazy
they're crooked
they're crooked as hell
they're do-nothing
they're going to have to fight a little while
they're going to move back a little bit
they're looking they may find those deleted emails
they're not going to win
they're not going to win it
they're so deep seeded
they're suppressed
they're traveling back and they'll be back soon and we'll have a big conference on it
they're worse now than they ever have been
they're worse now than they've ever been
they've already started buying
they've been trying to pass it for almost 50 years
they've done nothing wrong
they've gone down trillions of dollars and we are so far number one so far that they'll never catch us if we are smart right here
they've gone nuts
they've had the worst year they've had in 27 years and we're having the best year we've ever had
they've taken out thousands and thousands of ms-13 killers
they've taken thousands of killers and brought them back
think of how bad
think of it
think of that
this guy knows less than i do
this includes putting a stop to the catastrophic era of endless wars
this is a great state
this is cnn texas is in play
this is just like fake news
this is the state where a small band of patriots at the battle of gonzalez armed with a single canon stared down a foreign army and declared 
this is the state where william travis james bowie and davy crockett made their last stand at the alamo
this is true
those are not two good things in texas to get rid of
those embers they kept going going going
thousands of american soldiers have lost their lives
thousands of people outside that couldn't get in
today we choose a different path
today's democrats believe anyone who opposes them must be crushed
today's do nothing democrats they don't do anything
together we will elect a republican congress to create a safe modern fair and lawful system of immigration
tonight we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the democrat party and nobody ever pays the price with the democrats
tough
true story
turkey didn't want to budge and turkey was having a lot of bad things happen from this region
used to have no people waiting in mexico
very different
virtually every top democrat also now supports late-term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
we added that in
we are finally again and we've been doing it now for almost three years
we are going to keep on fighting
we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god
we became because of what they do not the republicans and not what we've done because what they've done and what they see
we become policemen
we believe in the creeds of self-reliance personal responsibility and american independence
we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true bedrocks of our society
we built in the last three years we built the strongest military by far
we can't darling the wind isn't blowing
we can't do it sir
we can't handle it
we catch and we release
we demand that you build it
we did banking
we did everything
we didn't win anything for years practically
we don't consider them to be a developing nation
we don't want it
we eliminated a record number of regulations and we ended the war on a thing called american energy which is very good for texas
we end up becoming police were policing these countries
we forget that
we get beijing for one dollar
we got rid of the individual mandate from crazy obamacare
we got to 306
we got to cement it
we got to use that more often
we had 18
we had tremendous success today
we have a man who's smart as hell and he is tough and he is mean and nasty but he loves this state and he's only mean and nasty because he wants to defend you and me and all of the horrible things that we all go through louie gohmert
we have a woman who's fantastic who has been a fan of ours right from the beginning kay granger
we have news conferences
we have this crazy guy on television
we have to get her
we have to know
we hope he's going to jump in
we just met such a great deal with china
we lose 500 billion
we lose with everybody
we love our country
we must hold the democrats accountable for their lies and their corruption
we only buy american tractors
we passed for the veterans va choice and va accountability on behalf of those great people
we spend so much time with them on the wall and i realized about two weeks ago all i had to do is say 
we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
we tell them this they will not put it in the press

what they want to teach your kids not good
what we've done has never been done before
what's another idea
what's another idea
what's wrong with these people
whatever he does it's going to be successful
when all of our stars and we have great stars when they went to our speaker of the house at the time and they asked for subpoenas oh let's take it easy
when did you ever hear that
when i got into office they say the most important thing a president can do i actually think it's defense but they say is the appointment of federal judges
when is the fighting going to start
when people come to my office which is now the oval office which is your office too
when the governor called up dan was there 
when the wall is complete there'll be as strong as any borders anywhere in the world
when's the fighting going to start
where are those emails hillary

wherever
whether you are a first-generation or tenth-generation and every american citizen and you do you've been treated so badly
while these charges are totally unsubstantiated
while we're fighting for shared priorities the american people the democrat party has never been farther outside of the mainstream
who are these people
who are these people
who are they
who is she
who is she
who is that guy
who is the whistleblower
who would have believed we could do that

with your help we will lift millions of more citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
with your help we will win back the house
with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working
without a little tough love they would have never made this deal
without spilling a drop of american blood not one drop of american blood
would have been so much easier ted would've been so much easier
yeah we're trying
yet every major democrat running for president wants to abolish all production of oil and natural gas
you always have to do the unexpected
you believe it
you catch them
you get none
you go back four years you go back seven six eight even you go back into another administration you go back 10 and 12 years where were you compared to where you are right now
you got to give her credit
you got to let them fight and then you pull them apart
you have no idea
you have no idea how dishonest the media is
you have to be a little bit different to do it that way
you know
you know he was president of his class
you know he's going to win
you know he's going to win
you know he's going to win don't you
you know i have to say this
you know i really don't believe anymore that they love our country
you know i thought pocahontas was gone left in embers
you know our farmers didn't want that money
you know that
you know that don't you
you know that right in fort worth
you know that's called
you know that's like the academy awards used to be before it failed
you know the old days my father taught me if you can spend less that's a good thing not a bad thing right
you know the wall
you know they have a certain max we broke the record tonight
you know they say he has immunity
you know we had in 2016 i really believe it was maybe the greatest election
you know we've had a lot of we've had a lot of obama people and clinton people and some to be honest with you we've had some pretty bad republicans down deep that didn't exactly love us
you know what and pillage
you know what i did for the farmer
you know what the loopholes are right
you know what tough love is right
you know what word i'm talking about right
you know when countries send them up they're not sending their finest okay use your heads they're not sending their finest
you know when i won in the primaries and then i won the election i was treated horribly by the media horribly
you know why
you know why
you know why it failed
you know why it failed
you made a fortune on the hurricane
you plant the baby tree it's got to catch get that extra time
you remember he was flailing all over the place
you remember that one from last year
you saw that right
you say 
you see that
you see that happening all the time
you watch
you're a great first lady
you're being targeted unfairly
you're right
you're working out for the a hundred yard dash or the mile it's a different form of training
you've got to see some of the people
you've seen it many times
your economy is the greatest on earth
$16 billion
1
1
100% because when i say something i mean it
132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernie sanders' government healthcare takeover bill
16 and 12 the year before and you were targeted
180000 million people but i'm not going to knock it because i want bernie to bring it right up to the end and we'll debate it the day before the election
2016 november
250 billion will end up being much much more than that
250000
270 electoral college
28
28 times he lied
306 223 so they were right 
5 billion people
5 billion people think of that and we are just touching it
5 million facility to support our iowa guardsmen at camp dodge right here in des moines iowa
9% especially when we're watching it
99
a
a japan south korea europe when that happens
a lot her like lack of ability
a the biggest trade deal ever signed in the history of the world
above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america
abraham lincoln
absolutely not
actually sir we've known about that plan for 52 years we just couldn't get it approved
african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded think of that
after being set free the same criminal raped brutalized and murdered a 92 year old woman
again we have never had because they respect us now they didn't respect us
all i have to do is say 
all over the world
all over the world
also first gentleman kevin reynolds kevin
although you had an ex-governor here that had very good genes too
america is respected again
america is thriving like never before and ladies and gentlemen and especially the great ladies and gentlemen of iowa the best is yet to come
and all she does is work on the hoax and work on all of the stuff
and ambassador lighthizer said 
and as sean hannity would say msdnc you know what msdnc is right so bad
and based on the polls i guess i'm not going to lose in this state
and by the way joni ernst and the great chuck grassley are right now in washington fighting for fairness fighting the hoax fighting for all of us
and he talked about opportunity zones first time i heard it
and i got it done
and i've told this story before when we were signing we were almost finished and i said 
and installed massive barriers to your exports
and just quickly we have the world's tallest campaign manager brad parscale
and let the people down the road tell you about that okay
and median household income is at an all time high just for one second president bush eight years $450
and republican national committee co-chair who has done an incredible job tommy hicks
and so they don't love our country i swear they don't
and some of those people some of those people are stone cold killers
and strong pioneer women who defied the dangers to carve out a life and a beautiful home with great families and great neighbors
and that's a great thing
and the truth is we have certain advantages but we also have a people advantage
and then i was left with one hillary clinton and that worked out very nicely
and then i will tell you how totally insane it is
and then people even farm people said 
and they can use it
and they want to wipe out totally iowa ethanol
and they would call too
and they would have forced its building and i would have said 
and those tractors that i told you to buy your tractors will be 60 years old if they have anything to do with it
and two great supreme court justices by the way
and under the so-called trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of any group
and we are thrilled to be joined tonight by a lot of your great leaders a lot of your really wonderful people
and we did it and there is nothing nobody has ever seen anything like it
and we ended catch and release
and we have a great football player from iowa matt whitaker is here matt
and we have somebody that you never heard of somebody that's a fantastic person but you never heard of somebody named sarah sanders
and we have the great negotiator the great man bob lighthizer with us here someplace
and we live by the words of our national motto in god we trust
and we're letting them use the drug and it's working in a lot of cases
another record is that between the ages of 25 and 34 people are now working and that's a record the number of people 25 to 34
anti-climb panel
anybody like to join ice
anyway republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race religion color and creed
as part of my commitment to rebuild our military we secured an $8
at stake in our present battle is the survival frankly of our nation
be a 
because i asked sonny perdue
because i'm a very visual person
because it's easy to be presidential but only have about three people in front of me
because nobody can pronounce his name
because of that there is no death tax or inheritance tax as they call it
because of the internet sadly the worst in the history of our world
because that really took the guts out of it and we're running it much better
because they are fighting for us
because they learned it's a really bad issue for them
because they were with the democrats for a hundred years more
because this is really true all over the country
because together we will make america wealthy again
because we have great doctors at the va
because you know they targeted you and now we're friends with china
before i took office washington looked the other way while china stole our secrets from american agriculture
big big thing
biofuel also but the socialist democrats want to shut down american energy
boy
but americans across the political spectrum were disgusted by the washington democrats the partisan hoaxes the witch hunts the con jobs
but but in the meantime i'm going to give you $12 billion out of these tens of billions that we're collecting
but did you see they did a new york times poll i think and sienna sienna new york times of iowa and they have me pitted against every one of the socialists and we're winning by a lot
but essentially it's totally different because of individual mandate
but every day we're achieving extraordinary victories for the citizens of the hawkeye state
but he was responsible more than anybody else 90% they say of these roadside bombs sent to fight us he was responsible and he took a hard hit
but i don't want to attack the green new deal because they might change it
but i made one mistake with the wall
but i never forgot when cnn fake news and all these people they go around interviewing the farmers
but i said to sonny perdue secretary of agriculture i said 
but in the papers and on the fake news cable shows and the regular look nbc is horrible the nbc nightly news it's terrible
but irredeemable remember
but nobody has ever asked
but only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all
but she said 
but she said another word that was worse
but the democrats are trying to overturn the last election
but the era of economic surrender is over because now we are finally putting america first america first
but then they went to washington
but this person a real expert said 
but those secrets were being stolen stolen
but we got 306 to 223
but we have got it closed up but we're getting your people in
but we will never let that side get in and by the way that's the least of it
but we're working with china just so you know and other countries very very closely so it doesn't get out of hand but it's something that we have to be very very careful with right
but weeks ago we also signed a terrific new trade agreement with china that will boost american agriculture by $50 billion every year and many other businesses like manufacturing banking finance overall $250 billion and you know with the farmers because i have a place in my heart for the farmers big
but what i am good at is getting things approved and i got it approved
but you couldn't have made it because there was too much money $16 billion
but you know how you remember it
but you know it is true
but you know the only thing i didn't understand i said 
but you know they made a trade deal with the united states
but you know what
but you know what
but you're going to make a lot of money
buttigieg
buttigieg
buttigieg
by the thousands
by the time they got to the doctor
by the way in all due respect you know who's going to pay for the wall right
by the way we're building the wall

democrats stand for crime corruption and chaos
did you get lucky
did you see in new jersey a couple of nights ago
did you see the other day where drug dealers got caught at the top
didn't he do a great job for transparency
do you believe this is the only country in the world
do you have any idea how smart i am
do you mind if we don't go tonight
do you promise if you lose that you will support the winner and i sort of i didn't exactly say yes
do you think he is happy
do you think that would ever i said they will figure a way
do you think this is easy
doing that is very easy
doing this takes far more talent than doing that
don't call him an animal
don't make it 20 make it 50
don't say it
don't worry
donald trump said that the governor of california promised a rolls-royce to illegal immigrants
down the road they get the same test for $57
drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years
during national school choice week school choice everybody we continue our fight to rescue children trapped in failing government schools
during this campaign season the good people of iowa have had a front row seat to the lunacy and the madness of the totally sick left
earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% for the first time ever for the first time ever
eight years 975
enjoy your life
especially when you just left michigan and you just left other places and you got maniacs doing a number on you all the time for three years
europe europe europe is next
even the exit polls they took it right up
every prime minister president king queen dictator whatever you want to call them they all say 
everybody wants money
everybody was ripping off the american farmer
everyone
everyone said well they kept getting me maybe if i have a great night 269 but 269 loses
everyone's got deplorable
everything now is going to transparencies where hospitals doctors everybody has to tell you how much things are costing
everything out here they love trump and you should love trump with what i've done
fake news has reported
fast
finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america in less than 10 years
for decades politicians ran for office promising to protect american farmers and workers
for south korea not for us it was for south korea
for years you watched as your politicians apologized for our country
from cambridge good old cambridge
globalist politicians allowed other countries to raid our factories ravage our farms rob our workers and ransack our communities
go down the line
good evening ladies and gentlemen

goodbye iowa have a good time
great governor longest serving governor in history actually 24 years
great great job
great job
great job adam
great people
great to be in the great state of ohio
have you ever heard of her
having a great memory but sometimes you take little clues
he always gets the name wrong
he cannot get to 270
he cannot get to 270
he didn't do anything wrong how am i going to get him
he didn't promise them
he didn't try too hard
he got it on a lie but we've run it much better
he lies awake at night shifting and turning shifty
he loved roadside bombs
he presides over a city that's failed
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said transparency because it's a big deal
he says 
he says 
he talked like 
he took a very hard hit
he was responsible for murdering and maiming thousands and thousands of americans and hundreds of thousands of other people
he was the mastermind of the road side bomb
he'll do it and he's doing it
he's a human being
he's a sick puppy
he's a sick puppy
he's an animal
he's falling asleep
he's going 
he's great
he's in iowa
he's not going to do well here or there
he's not going to do well with that group
he's not going to do well with this group
he's not running
he's skipping four or five states
he's so lost
hello iowa you have no choice
her crazy bernie biden buttigieg
here i am on the debate stage 
here it is
hillary clinton was in charge of the deal right
honest abe
honestly people were waiting in line they weren't very sick they were terminally ill truthfully before they saw a doctor
honestly that poor guys is so lost
hopefully everything's going to be great
how about buttigieg
how about this crazy crazy senator from hawaii
how about this crazy senator
how am i going to get him
how did you do it
how do i lose
how is she taking her defeat
how many times has he missed it
how much are the farmers getting
how the hell are we going to get to hawaii
how you doing
i came up with that name but they won't give me credit for that
i can be more presidential than any other past president other than perhaps abraham lincoln when he's wearing the hat
i can tell you right now
i can't even believe it but i don't want to knock it because the green new deal which would crush our farms destroy our wonderful cows
i did transparency i took the guts i did transparency and then i'm going to watch as somebody else says 
i did well
i didn't run but i'm running this time and we've got to take back the house
i didn't say yes in all fairness but i got sort of like six the 68% there
i don't blame china
i don't care that she's a stone cold crook
i don't even like it
i don't even mention that because that's massive by any other standard but it's peanuts compared to the usmca and the china deal right
i don't know
i don't know if you can but hello des moines
i don't like the way it sounds in this speech but i'm going to say it because i'm not looking to have them look good
i don't think i will lose in any other state either
i don't think so
i don't think that would ever happen
i don't want to talk about until about two months before the election
i don't want you to be there
i endorsed her very early right
i go to walter reed and i see him and the young man his legs were blown off
i got impeached
i got out of jail
i had 36 farmers and i said 
i had a choice do we run it well or do we run it poorly
i had no idea
i had no idea it was going to be this sick and this degenerated
i had no idea that the swamp was that evil but we're winning
i have an expert on healthcare
i have an idea that i have wanted to do for years but we have never had a president that could pull it off
i just left michigan and michigan is booming now because of me meaning my people
i just saw new york times can you believe
i just want to be here to watch a speech
i just want to be here to watch his speech
i kept hoping but i think honestly i think that sleepy joe crazy bernie i don't even want to put buttigieg in but i think they'd actually be tougher than her
i know talent
i know the people of iowa don't care about this but we are making substantial investments in rural healthcare
i know who the people that you have and they are hard workers
i like it
i like it
i like to do them one at a time one at a time
i love cows
i love right to try
i love you too
i made that mistake once with the farmers
i mean i don't even know
i mean i'm doing a lot for that place
i mean pretty soon we'll be setting records in speed
i mean you never saw anything living on their most important entryways into what was a great city san francisco
i never forgot it
i ran on a lot of different issues but trade was one of them
i ran on the issue trade
i really mean that
i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said i was going to build a wall
i said kim 
i said to her the other day they said 
i said to this group of farmers that came in 
i say 
i say to prime minister abe he's a friend of mine 
i sent one of them the father to china and he's now ambassador to china
i should have said 
i should have said 
i should worried
i signed it already
i think before i came down the escalator with our future first lady i think really they were doing it then
i think he is happy
i think i'm the smartest person so i came up with a plan
i think she made a bad speech last night
i think so
i think so
i think that irredeemables going to get her
i told sonny 
i used the word subsidy
i used to say how do we allow these companies to close fire everybody go to another country
i voted for crooked hillary
i voted for trump
i want those farmers to come back say 
i want to get back sir
i want to take care of everyone everyone
i want to take care of the small farmer too not just the big monsters
i want you to be where you are
i wanted to finish china before we started on europe
i went and i saw ambassador lighthizer's in charge he's fantastic
i went back and i told my people 
i went there a lot many times
i went to him i said 
i went to maine
i won that group
i won't i promise
i worked so hard
i worked so hard for this state
i'd rather do without that panel
i'd read the down the worst on crime the worst on education
i'll never forget i was in new hampshire i came up with this idea because everybody kept coming up to me and saying 
i'll say it anyway
i'll tell you the spirit of these people it may even top the farmers
i'll tell you u
i'm a very organized person
i'm going to give you
i'm going to give you $12 billion for the year before and i'm going to give you $16 billion for this year
i'm going to win tomorrow
i'm not going to get into it washing down into the ocean washing down onto their beaches people living in tents if they're lucky
i'm not going to mention all the names because all those cameras that are rolling they don't like it when i do it but one they don't mind is governor kim reynolds
i'm putting in $20 billion
i'm sorry
i'm thrilled to be back in american heartland with thousands of loyal hardworking american patriots
i'm totally in favor
i'm totally in favor of the green new deal
i'm voting for her
i'm voting for trump or clinton or trump
i've always had a great memory for whatever reason but memory is a great thing
i've had him up to here
i've never heard that before
if bernie or sleepy joe has i mean joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a round table
if it all works out and you have the best product the best product in the world if it all works out it will just keep expanding
if they're too dangerous we have no choice
if we don't win your farms are going to hell
if we run it poorly everyone's going to blame me
if we run it well everyone's going to give him credit especially the fakers back there right
if you can't get to a doctor quickly you go outside you go locally you get a doctor we pay the bill you get yourself all better
if you don't love your children don't leave it to them and that particular tax won't matter
if you look at a chart for 15 years actually not eight for 15 years it's like a roller coaster ride down for the farmer
if you love your children that's a great thing
if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november of 2020
if you're winston churchill if you make that mistake at the beginning of your speech it's over
illegal crossings now are down 75% since last spring
illegal immigration costs our nation hundreds of billions of dollars drains public services overcrowds our schools and hospitals and threatens innocent american lives at a number that you wouldn't even believe
in fact maybe we've never had a better relationship and were working with them very closely on the coronavirus
in less than 10 years the aids epidemic will be eradicated will be gone
in short this election is a choice between american freedom and democratic socialism and in some cases in my opinion it's worse than socialism
in terms of human trafficking people don't even talk about it
in the state of virginia they want to take your guns away you believe it
in this region of the county alone last year ice officers arrested nearly 4000 illegal aliens charged or convicted of heinous crimes including robbery rape and murder
in your local hospital
incredible
incredible the strides that we've made
instead i work my ass off up here okay
iowa became one of the first states to pass school choice
irredeemables
is another colossal victory for american agriculture like you have never had before
is everything okay in iowa
is he happy
is there anybody here who loves your children
isn't it a terrible what he's doing with the trade
it barely got any mention
it barely got any mention
it creates fairness with mexico
it doesn't sound complicated
it is genius what they have been able to do what you have been able to do
it is wait
it may even top the farmers which is pretty good
it should have been done years ago
it was a brilliant round table
it was called greatness
it was called greatness
it was deplorable
it was just a one way street
it was like oh you think about it
it was over for him actually if you knew him a long time ago
it was so beautiful and now it's a disgrace being watched all over the world
it was wonderful
it will happen because they have no choice
it would be great but we have to have it
it's a beautiful story
it's a big deal
it's a degenerate swamp
it's a great plan
it's a happy period
it's a happy period because we call this impeachment light
it's a little hot in this room
it's a massive win and it creates some fairness with canada
it's a massive win for iowa farmers and workers of all kinds
it's a real beauty
it's a really bad issue
it's a takeover of your healthcare that would strip all of those 180000 million great americans of your private coverage
it's a very dark period
it's a very hard panel to climb the panel on top
it's all a con job
it's already happening
it's been great
it's called promises made promises kept
it's called the democrat party
it's coming back to you you see that
it's crazy
it's doing so badly in a state that's having the greatest year they've ever had and they have a great governor also and they had a great governor

opportunity zones

other than that they're fine people

otherwise everything that you've built in your entire life will be gone
our brave warriors launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist qasem soleimani
our great first lady is helping us with that
our new agreement with china will protect our intellectual property and pry open vast new markets for american beef pork poultry seafood soybeans rice dairy and much much more
our numbers with african american workers people are through the roof
people are using it and it's great
people don't realize this is a lot of work
people go in for a blood test they get charged $2700
people leave
please don't ever use that word
please we have a little information
plenty left over
president barack hussein obama eight years eight years $975
president donald john trump two and a half years not three because the numbers were taken at two and a half now it's actually higher
president obama couldn't even come close
probably the biggest reason that i ran was the unfair trade that i've seen and one after one china mexico canada japan south korea we've made all these deals and we have plenty left over
promises met
proud citizens like you helped to build this country and together we are taking back our country
put it away
qasem soleimani
really
really these people are very very bad for our country
registered democrats and independents are leaving the democrat party in droves and we are welcoming these people and these great voters to the republican party with wide open arms
remember
remember
remember
remember deplorables
remember i always said 
remember i thought i could just build concrete slabs
remember it
remember nixon it was like a dark period right
remember obama 28 times 
remember that
remember that speech so innocently given talking about deplorables
remember the debate
remember the democrats
remittance
report to an operating room when you have a cold okay
republicans stand for law order and justice
rich people are investing vast amounts of money

sanctuary city policies aren't just wrong they're immoral and they're lethal and they really are something that has to be stopped
say edge edge
say something
secretary of agriculture
see he won't
see to show you how fake they are one of the newscasters said 
sell
sell sell they'll be saying 
seven years they all voted for it they just didn't have the ability to build it
she called them deplorable and irredeemable and me being so brilliant i said 
she didn't lie
she doesn't know that they don't want airplanes anymore and yet they fly around in brand new gulfstreams in brand new planes all over the place
she is a terrific person great person
she is really involved
she lies about a lot of other things but she didn't lie
she said 
she said it's going to produce 250000 jobs and she was right
she said our people are irredeemable
she said that would be 
she was so easy
she would call me up kim you would call
she's done a great job
she's in trouble
she's the one that doesn't do it
shifting and turning in his bed sweating like a dog
shifty schiff
shinzo
shockingly as that wall gets longer the crossings get less
should have been started earlier but we started
should have been started in the last administration
should've been done years and years ago
shows you how good i am at politics i said 
since the election we have created seven million new jobs
sir $16 billion last year
sir i want to get back
sir it's really terrible what's happening with healthcare
sir sir we can't do it
sir that's anti-climb panel
sir we can't produce that much
sir we don't want anything
sir we don't watch subsidy
sir you have to do what's right
so $16 billion is the biggest
so i always say 
so i came up with this incredible plan
so i don't even mention it
so i said 
so i went back
so they got meaning you a lot of you in this audience got $12 billion and you got 16 so you got $28 billion over that short period of time and you were able to actually in some cases i guess thrive
so we now have in the contract from 40 to $50 billion worth of purchase
so we renegotiated the deal if i have your permission we renegotiated the deal and now we have a good deal with south korea okay
so we're going to win the great state of iowa and it's going to be a historic landslide
so what i did is i put a 25% tariff on everything coming in from china $250 billion and then more tariffs on things beyond the $250 billion market
so whatever happened it happened
so when you're having a hard time gee what's u-s just think of the song ymca and you'll remember it usmca
so when you're looking down at your children you're saying 
so you're fighting that and you're doing farm bills
socialism's a kind word by comparison
soleimani was actively planning new attacks but we ended his bloody rampage forever
some cases they don't have both
some of those people in the caravans right
sometimes i'd say 
sonny what's the biggest number that china's ever done with the farmers
sonny what's the number
sorry you got to get out
south korea we're protecting them all all these different things
soybeans
speaker of the iowa house of representatives a man with really fantastic genes got to have like the best genes in the world

thanks to our bold reforms we're now offering health plans that are 60% cheaper than obamacare
thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row and they're getting lower and lower
thanks to republican leadership american now has the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth not even close
thanks to the courage of american heroes the isis caliphate has been totally destroyed and its founder and leader the animal known as al-baghdadi is dead
that always happens whenever i say cnn their camera goes off
that had a tremendous impact
that is such a big thing for melania
that is why i have asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
that is why we need to elect more republicans nationwide to end sanctuary cities in all 50 states
that means you are next
that swamp is bad
that swamp is bad
that was a mistake
that was last year for this year
that was over 10 years ago
that was so big
that was the worst word 
that's a beauty
that's a good problem not a bad problem
that's a good thing
that's a great thing
that's a real beauty
that's a record
that's a tough job but they love to do it
that's an anti-climb panel
that's maximum
that's not bad
that's not bad
that's not happening i can tell you that
that's nothing compared to what they have to do
that's okay
that's okay
that's pretty good
that's terrible
that's very tall
that's what happened
that's what it is
that's what they wanted
that's what's happening all over our country
the average unemployment rate under my administration listen to this is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country
the best
the best trade deals the strongest military i took care of the vets
the camera just went off
the democrats
the democrats will lose because america will never be a socialist country
the farmer would say 
the farmers came to see me and they said 
the good news is people don't watch it like they used to because they don't believe in it
the great state and you have a great governor by the way
the great state of indiana so i don't see that one
the highest ever was 16 so we made it 20
the iowa unemployment rate has reached an all time low in history
the last time i came i never did this before i never ran so they all said 
the last time this last budget they didn't really fight us on the wall
the lowest unemployment rate
the next day i'm speaking and women are walking around i'm deplorable
the powerful border wall was starting to set
the president of mexico is doing a great job
the press never talks about my crowds
the problem was we couldn't get the money but we got all the money we need now
the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and the late great abraham lincoln
the same exact test
the song i just walked in on
the u
the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth by far
the usmca you know when you have a hard time with that one memory is a great thing
the wall is the top of the line
the washington democrats have never been more extreme
the whole world respects us now
the world's longest track
the worst it's ever been but when we have this border it makes it very very tough for them to come into the united states with women and with children stuffed in trunks in the back of a car
their camera just went off
their warriors
them and shifty schiff is a very sick person
then 
then she is asking for things i never even heard of but we got them all whatever that hell she wanted we got

they came to see me
they can't take a little humor
they can't take it
they catch somebody on the border
they come up with a medicine but it has to go through the fda procedure right
they could never find anyone saying bad about trump
they couldn't figure it out but i can figure it out
they couldn't get it passed
they couldn't get over
they couldn't get over and they're like mountain climbers
they did they picked up some seats
they didn't want that because you have to be able to see through
they don't believe in it
they don't care about the farmer
they don't get enough credit
they don't give me credit for anything
they don't give me credit for fake news
they don't talk about that
they gave us $500 million a year more
they gave us 500
they got caught because you know that panel
they got this they got that they got 10 different things all horrible
they got used to climbing
they have certain statutory requirements et cetera
they have no choice

they like him and wisconsin and a lot of the farm states and they targeted

they love him
they love him in all these states
they love him in iowa
they love him in nebraska
they love him in wisconsin
they love our country
they never mention anything
they never mention crowds
they never mention crowds
they put up 27000 soldiers on our southern border and the numbers are plummeting 87% down
they respect us
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said donald trump who spoke before a nice crowd
they said they picked up the house in '18 but i didn't run in '18
they say 
they say 
they say 
they say that with johnson it was a long time ago none of us remember but they say it was a very dark period
they set up a round table because the crowd was so small and then they'll say 
they set up a round they just said 
they sold everything out
they sold your jobs out
they started even before i came down on the escalator
they started screaming at her in hawaii they said 
they support representative ocasio-cortez
they talk about all the other stuff but the trade deal that is going to change our country
they talk about the impeachment hoax
they talk healthcare she said 
they tamed the wilderness braved the elements tilled the soil planted the fields and help make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are making it greater and greater every single day
they targeted trump states
they turned the term around
they understand it
they want every
they want hundreds of thousands of people to flow into our country
they want open borders
they want to kill our cows
they want to kill our cows
they want to nullify your ballots poison our democracy and overthrow the entire system of government
they want to wipe it out
they went to washington and they sold you out
they were all for it
they were great
they were stupid
they will be 60 years old
they will be old tired exhausted
they won't let you use it
they would absolutely destroy you
they would have given me so much money to build a wall
they would just absolutely destroy you
they would say 
they wouldn't give him to the ice warriors
they'd go into diners
they'll pay more
they're admitting they're terminally ill and you won't let them use a drug that may work
they're all coming back
they're all watching tonight
they're always very accurate but this time something happened
they're buying your stuff again like crazy like crazy
they're coming in like never before

this deal will be so big
this great state was founded by tough tough tough frontier men
this is a blue collar boom and that's a good thing too
this is a happy period for us
this is a radical left people that we're dealing with

to keep america safe we have fully rebuilt the united states military
to me it was so big
to me that was worse
to rock rapids from melbourne to moorhead and from davenport to right here in des moines iowa
to uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 federal judges a record who will interpret the constitution as one
today you saw it i hit my highest poll numbers since i got elected because the american people and frankly people all over the world know it's a hoax
today's democrat party glorifies illegal immigration vilifies the heroes of law enforcement and pledges to dissolve immigration control entirely
today's democrat party i don't say democratic party it sounds so much better in a speech right
today's democrat party is run by left wing extremists who want to massively raise your taxes increase regulations cancel your health plans raid medicare shut down american energy destroy your social security they will destroy your social security eliminate religious liberty punish free speech confiscate your guns abolish your borders and indoctrinate america's children with hateful left-wing ideology
together we are going to win back the house
together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration
trafficking in women and children all over the world
transparency is bigger than healthcare because you will see prices tumbling like you wouldn't believe

we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine
we will build the wall
we will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products made raised farmed and grown right here in the usa
we will defend privacy free speech religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
we will make america proud again
we will make america safe again and we will make america great again
we will make america strong again

a man who i just did a phone call for the other night and the people love him
a suburbanite thank you thank you
a woman or a man
a+
absolutely
achieving the highest median income in the history of our country
actually also she was the one that treated you know that she was the one that treated him so badly
actually it's a lot more accurate than these polls that interview like 97 people have been interviewed then they charge you a million dollars and they probably don't interview the people
air force one is two planes
all elizabeth warren pocahontas had to do is leave
all right first lady don't worry about it
all right first lady that's the first story on nbc but don't worry

all they care about is fill that seat right
all those empty buildings all over the place but a lot of them now are filled up because of us
america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars

and accountability where we can fire people in the va that aren't taking great care of our vets okay
and all it is is for political reasons
and all of the technology will be maintained here
and america we pick it up
and by the way that's a very accurate poll because that's the way i feel
and catherine his wife is great
and deb what a great she's doing such a good job
and do you see what their approval rating has gone to
and every time i go in he goes 
and everybody finds it fascinating
and guess what
and guess what
and he became an instant fan of trump
and he broke his leg and his arm and he was all screwed up
and he ends up getting the nomination
and he paid a fortune for it
and he was for a long time before i even got to know him
and he was from literally day one right from the beginning
and he was like 
and he'd sometimes have press conferences
and he's been so important he's the king 39 million listeners
and he's got a couple of bills that he's putting in one in particular i love it
and hello north carolina hello north carolina
and hope to god we never have to use them
and i couldn't even say 
and i had a lot of people that 
and i had to give this answer
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i said it last night we had a great rally
and i said last night i said and yeah your friends were there
and i said that a week ago and it was a headline and one of these fake newspapers where 
and i saw people they never show
and i say concast and immediately there goes their public how's your public relations doing nbc
and i see we have a storm
and i shouldn't say this and the fake news keeps going 
and i think he's doing very well
and i think your opponent has some very big problems
and i was about 45 minutes into the speech and i realized i was only on line two
and i wasn't covered
and i will tell you this you're going to have socialized medicine
and i'm going to read the questions off the teleprompter and the questions are so easy
and if he loses the left coast that's the end of his election
and in many ways i had to go back to work but i had to go back to work on this one too
and in syria we're all back we're all finished except for one thing
and it found out that about 700 years ago there was a possible event 1024th right
and it is fascinating
and it was just a total disaster
and it was the best area the best
and it's a shut down
and it's just unbelievable
and it's true your kids come home and they tell you things
and it's unfair he worked so hard
and ivanka made a great speech right
and last time remember how many people i got from bernie because of trade
and maybe he'll show up for an hour-and-a-half at a debate
and my only problem is they did it so fast
and no party can lead america that will not teach our children to love america
and north carolina republican party chair michael whatley
and now they will say anything
and now we're doing it again and we're doing it very rapidly
and now we're going up and up and up and we're winning and we're winning all over the place
and obama lied 28 times when he said you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan
and of course he joined and wanted to join the paris climate accord
and our air force one is 31 years old
and pennsylvania
and religion
and she is the furthest left person of anybody
and she treated kavanaugh very badly too
and somebody said i'm down in maine
and talking just talking with everyone
and that includes fox which has changed a lot changed a lot sad
and that includes germany
and that is exactly what we're going to do
and that was actually a good thing because it delayed the signing of that horrible deal which i terminated
and that's an easy one because h comes before but he always gets it wrong
and that's not including energy because look what you're paying for your gasoline now
and that's what we're going to do
and that's why they're pushing so hard because they know he's going to be out very soon and she's going to take over
and the fake news can call him up and check
and the fake news wouldn't show up
and the guy admitted it
and the leader of the pack i would say was kamala was the worst and pocahontas was a close second
and the peace prize nobel version zero time for president trump
and the secretary general stoltenberg of nato said 
and then everybody laughed i laughed
and then i watch him last night reading something saying that i opened i closed it up one week later one week
and then i went home two days later
and then i went to the legal legals here and i said 
and then it's written to totally bend the truth to make a good thing into a bad thing
and then she went out to and she choked remember that
and then somebody said 
and then the fake news says 
and then the following day i watched a certain show that does like us and they said 
and then their third story is about something with me i don't know something bad they found out
and then there was a second story about something
and then they looked at the screen and said 
and then they say bad things about your president
and then ukraine $183000 a month and a $3 million upfront payment for him and his friends think of this with no experience and no job and they said do you know energy
and these guys were sort of wise guys right
and they all admit it until the press comes in front where they say 
and they cut it off before the end they don't see any i said 
and they didn't cover it
and they didn't cover the story
and they had guts and they had what it takes
and they had nothing
and they like god
and they like it so much they gave up the plan
and they were sort of agreeing with me
and they'll say 
and they're all saying 
and this is a lot of people
and this is the guy that's going to tell us what to do with something that's much more lethal much more lethal
and this is with a lot of shutdowns by democrats
and this was a big private meeting of all of the nations 
and together we are taking back our country
and together with the incredible people of north carolina we will make america wealthy again we will america strong again we will make america proud again
and two people i really liked because we fought like hell for them a year ago right
and watch to make sure they're not cheating which they will be
and we are getting better every single day
and we brought your jobs back home to north carolina and our contract
and we don't have to mention sean and laura and so many others
and we gave rush because he's such an important person and done such an incredible job the presidential medal of freedom
and we got it built
and we had other companies a lot of people wanted it
and we have made a lot of governors look very good
and we shouldn't say this is some kind of a rally from now on
and we went and we finished it
and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto and we will never change it by the way
and we'll always support america's incredible military families
and we're asking for biden's list
and we're energy independent
and we're going to keep it that way
and what they've done here by the way japan and what they've done in michigan ohio what they've done
and when i say 
and when obama got it here are the headlines
and when you test then you have does this make sense
and with israel uae and bahrain signed a deal with israel
and yet you're delinquent
and you can forget your tobacco industry you can forget your farmers
and you know they make up a lot of false stories
and you know what
and you know what
and you know what
and you know what
and you know what the funny thing
and you know what we've done
and you know what's going to happen in 45 days from now and you're watching those polls
and you would have done even better
and you're going to go to a better year we are going to have a better year
anyway i hope your husbands are okay with it
are they okay
are we up
as rush limbaugh would say barack hussein obama
as we meet tonight our nation mourns the loss of a legal giant supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg
at first they wanted a vaccine because they didn't think it could happen
barack hussein obama
because gasoline is so damn cheap right
because i happen to think i just say what i want
because i love maine too
because i said 
because i watched him into debates with all those people those democrats
because if he ever gave a list he'd either put somebody in the left middle which would be okay
because it's too simple because it works because it's better
because they took a man who's got nothing
because they're trying to hurt our numbers
because this guy woodward
because this other guy has just an ideology that's just terrible
because we have the right to cancel
because we like it to be on like a lot
because we're getting very close to that deal
because you were targeted right
before they thought we were stupid
behind him it was all fire for a block
below two
biden has repeatedly surrendered your jobs to china and other countries
biden his whole deal is catastrophic shutdown
biden is with china
biden says that this an election between scranton and park avenue
biden's own chief of staff said when they manage the h1n1 that he calls the n1h1 right
biden's running mate urged supporters to help bail rioters out of jail including one who attempted murder
biggest difference
biggest difference
both of us
both the white house and the senate majority have a moral duty to fulfill the promises they made to the voters
boy these guys are stupid
but 5 000 i said 
but a lot of activity in south carolina also they're doing great
but at the nato meeting one of the presidents of one of the good countries all good they said 
but bernie took a bad defeat didn't he
but de blasio is there and new york's finest first time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate they endorsed me three weeks ago
but don't send anything don't put it in writing
but he couldn't find any palm trees
but he doesn't say he left
but he would stand there and he would say 
but he's going down now to florida he's going to spend $100 million
but he's made it oftentimes right in new hampshire and it was vermont
but i always say 
but i could tell you stories like that all night long the aircraft carriers that cost 10 times more than they should cost and then they use the electric catapults
but i heard the same thing four years ago remember
but i say he's always using a teleprompter
but i went home
but i would give myself a d i would say i would give myself and my whole group because mike pence is great mike pence really was
but i would never say it
but i'll tell you
but i'll tell you what we're going to have a victory on november 3rd the likes of which you've never seen
but in just three and a half years under my administration we've secured america's borders rebuilt the awesome power of the u
but just to remember and he's telling us how to do things
but listen try sitting down with a radio show with millions and millions of people listening and talk for three hours without phone calls
but mark had a beautiful head of black hair and i just noticed that hair's turning white very fast
but mark just a few months ago i've been trying to get him for three years to leave and we have a great person running as you know
but nbc news is so i mean it's just terrible
but now biden is recklessly campaigning against his vaccine
but now you're really losing your doctor
but our economic numbers are so good
but rush has been unbelievable
but rush said 
but she choked
but the democrats don't want the vaccine
but the dumbest is joe
but they only show your face
but they said 
but they said the other night and it was amazing
but they're putting up $5 billion
but think of it there's hundreds of deals like that
but think of what i did
but thom tillis is with us
but we cannot do that
but we didn't run
but we have great support
but we have more fun
but we have some great ones too on fox
but we love pennsylvania
but we surged rapid testing kits
but we took care of the va with veterans choice
but we took care of them
but we will keep 
but we're actually getting very good
but we're doing a job
but we're going to do a vote
but we're having them outside
but when they managed the h1n1 swine flu this was from his top person that ran it
but you know
but you know i view it differently now i view china much differently now after the plague came in i view it differently
but you know what
but you know you have a president you love your president and your president gets honored because i'm not being honored you're being honored with the nobel peace prize for israel what we did with israel
but you're one person and that's why i got mark meadows involved because he's from north carolina
by the way he left scranton
by the way is the media now and i'm pretty sure it's getting close
by the way we all love south carolina right right

i said to boeing 
i said to my people 
i said to my wife last night we had this incredible crowd
i said to the general in charge i said 
i saw kerry this other day
i say 
i say 
i say 
i say 
i say all americans justice ginsburg's close relationship with a friend of ours a friend of mine justice scalia is also a powerful reminder that we can disagree on fundamental issues while treating each other with decency dignity and respect
i say it all the time
i see it
i see their plane
i see them all over the place they're great
i see you're up in the polls congressman richard hudson great guy
i should have asked for more
i shouldn't be banning china because i was xenophobic
i spoke to a great person in south carolina who said 
i start speaking i started speaking think of it one o'clock in the morning we had 30 you never saw anything like it
i tell it all the time texas right
i think honestly i think it's a disgrace
i think it came out very well it's always it comes out well
i think it could help it might make me better but i have none
i think it will be brought up in the debate i think
i think it will be brought up into debate
i think it's one of my greatest achievements
i think it's working out pretty good
i think nbc that's not only msdnc
i think nbc with lester holt
i think reagan won every state except for minnesota
i think she felt sorry for him
i think sleepy joe's worse do you want to know the truth
i think they have a lower approval rating than congress
i think we can do it for $190000
i think we love it
i think we were like 9 million people decided they wanted to wait and they've waited and you see what's going on
i thought we'd do a little better
i told them 
i took it out of the tariffs we charge
i totally opened it up
i want a platform damn it
i want from now on you to give me the questions before you ask me
i want other people really to feel sorry for themselves because we have somebody that knows what they're doing
i want to try one of those hats
i want you
i was born in pennsylvania
i was honored again
i was honored nobel peace prize nominated
i was recently honored to be endorsed by 54 sheriffs throughout this state and we're joined by many of them tonight
i was signing a sheet of paper you've heard this story $1
i went home and i said to the first lady 
i went in and i said 
i will never ride a bicycle during a negotiation
i will never speak to you again
i wish i had time to listen more often
i withdrew from last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal
i won't be putting forth a nominee next week
i won't do it
i won't say it
i won't say it
i won't say it susan
i won't say it susan
i would have been much tougher
i would imagine the sight lines aren't too good
i would just look i said 
i would like to have some
i wouldn't say it
i'd like to have a drug test
i'd like to rest i'd like to let kamala take over as president
i'd never heard that before
i'd never heard we're going to build a wall
i'd say that's a big difference
i'll give you a little
i'll take it he'll take
i'll tell you what if i do that from maine and if maine doesn't vote for trump
i'll tell you what it's true
i'm an indian
i'm getting tired
i'm glad we had them because we're dealing with a bunch of thieving bad people
i'm going to buy it from europe
i'm going to put up $100 million in florida we're going to go
i'm in los angeles
i'm just telling you that crazy
i'm just telling you that president putin and president xi of china russia china north korea everybody
i'm looking at some numbers and you're doing very well
i'm not doing it
i'm not giving it
i'm not going to do it
i'm not going to pay $5
i'm not looking to hurt them but they have 30% higher
i'm sorry
i'm sorry to say it does
i'm thrilled to be in fayetteville with thousands of loyal hard working american patriots
i'm tied
i'm trying to work on the fires
i'm very proud of this clause
i'm with america
i've never made that mistake so far
i've never seen
i've never seen softballs and actually they're getting hit by it
i've not familiar with the subject
if bernie sanders had a crowd
if biden wins china wins
if h1n1 had the same fatality rate as the china virus over two million people would have already perished
if he wins north carolina is screwed and so is every place else
if he would have just kept spending a couple of hundred million dollars a week on ads he could have won
if i ever said in fact i'm going to say it now
if i lose to him i don't know what i'm going to do
if it all goes i gave them the preliminary approval
if it's not me look what i've done
if it's okay with you
if she left before super tuesday bernie would have won every one of those states but they split up that vote
if they know they perhaps don't know
if those people come on bring them over
if we believed in pollsters we wouldn't be here right now
if we had listened to joe biden hundreds of thousands more americans would have died
if we win america wins north carolina wins pennsylvania wins and the american workers win in every single state
if we win north carolina we're going to win the whole thing because we're doing well everywhere from wilmington to charlotte from concord to raleigh and from greensboro to right here in fayetteville
if we win this state we're going to win the whole thing
if you add four or $5000 so you're talking about by $11000 you got to add the energy
if you do just leave the stage because you can never recover
if you say anything positive they say 
if you take a look automobile manufacturing housing retailing they're all setting records they're through the roof hard to believe actually during the rounding the corner when i say rounding the corner they go crazy
if you tariff our maine lobster people and fishermen and women if you want a tariff on them that's okay but we're going to tariff your cars okay
in a matter of weeks
in both the 2016 and the 2018 elections the american people chose a president and a senate majority united in their commitment to selecting nominees who believe in applying the constitution as written
in everything we do we're putting america first unlike other administrations and not just obama and biden
in fact he actually had 1% with an arrow pointing left
in fact we gained seats in the senate but they never talk about that
in fact we're about to crack 100 million tests
in fact we're gaining a generator
in fact we're taking school funds away from these crazy schools that are teaching horrible things bad things actually
in front of this message 
in god we trust
in my first three years we lifted 6
in three years of president trump real median household income rose by almost $7000
iowa nebraska you all of them
is it okay we kept the oil
is that possible
is that what you want
is there anything else you need
is this guy the worst negotiator
israel kosovo
it all ended
it all ended in minneapolis
it can't be done
it can't be kamala
it has to have a three on it not a four but three
it is a terrible thing he's done
it is so bad
it looked like berlin during the war
it never gets reported by these fakers
it saved a lot of money
it sounds good
it took you also had what
it was a bad loss
it was a joke
it was a joke everybody was laughing but they refused to go that extra quarter of a second
it was a lie
it was amazing how quickly those tariffs were taken off
it was amazing how the money came in
it was an amazing effect because other presidents said 
it was just forward
it was like a sea of people
it was obama took it away with the stroke of a pen
it was signed by obama
it was so big
it wasn't working the mission act
it will be a woman
it will be a woman a very talented very brilliant woman
it will be a woman unless wait okay let's do a poll
it would destroy your social security and protections for preexisting conditions it will
it wouldn't be built in 20 years from now
it'll be faster
it's a better location it's probably a better building
it's a disgrace
it's a disgrace what they're teaching them it's a disgrace
it's a helluva a plane
it's a little tough as president but everybody finds it fascinating
it's a lot of money but look it's a helluva a deal
it's about time
it's actually if he wins it's the single most brilliant campaign in the history of the world
it's actually two planes
it's all good stuff
it's all right
it's already done
it's already in very good shape
it's an energy company that paid it
it's as far as the eye can see it's a big crowd right
it's being taken care of
it's called a protest
it's called disinformation
it's called fill that seat and that's what we're doing
it's called included in the price
it's crazy
it's crazy
it's got a three on it
it's got to have a three in front of it
it's got to have a three on it
it's great to be with the great people of iowa
it's hard
it's just a terrible thing
it's like seven times 
it's massive
it's modern it's beautiful
it's much longer bigger wingspan much more beautiful
it's never been done before
it's okay
it's okay right
it's owned by a company called concast c-o-n concast they're con they're con men
it's political reasons
it's really between scranton and china you know that scranton and china
it's ridiculous
it's the craziest thing
it's the first time i've ever done it
it's the next story i'm sure it's the nobel prize for peace
it's the worst group of people
it's too much
it's unbelievable
it's unfair
it's very tough
it's when are they going to open
jobs retail stock market everything
joe biden
joe biden and the democrats want to gut police departments nationwide
joe biden is weak
just because i asked
just sign it president right now
just talk
just tell them 
just tell them we don't like the plane
kamala
larry ellison it's going to be an incredible combination
last night you saw that in a place that we're going to win
last one was the air force
last time i was tied in texas until the day of the vote
let me take a look at it sir
let somebody else finish it
let them come over
let's get rid of that big truck
let's give it one more quick chance
let's go back to my poll
let's make a t-shirt fill the seat
let's turn on the television
let's turn on the television
let's turn onto that fake nbc news
like 90 they're great
like can you believe it in one week they nominated me not for one but for two nobel prizes
like we did in minneapolis 30 minutes
like what i said about military
look at all that press
look at all those people back there look at that
look at nafta
look at these people
look at this crowd
look at what we've done
look he's been doing this for 47 years and i got a debate coming up with this guy
look i mean this guy's got this state totally closed down
look it they just form
look that's where they're coming from just so you know
look they're friends
look we can get it down but you're asking for too much
look what they're doing in pennsylvania
looks like cary grant
lou dobbs is great
love israel
magnets
maine
man oh man
many many car plants are now opening up
mark my words you will never ever sign deals with arab countries with israel
maybe a little area if it's such a spike we understand we have to take care of our senior citizens
maybe i'll sign an executive order
maybe we own some land
me-too-ed
michael
mini mikey wants that platform
most of them have already admitted it was all made up lies false accusations and they made him suffer
my people are so good tomorrow it'll be all over the place
my wife said 
nah we had some terrible negotiators and they all said i saw them the other day this was him like a year ago 
naturally this is an election not between scranton or wherever it is
nbc
next day it was a story 
next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country it's heading that way
no

no that's never done
no think of it
no this is a super v
no we were taken advantage of by the whole world
no we're not doing any shutdowns
no we're not going to do it
nobel peace can you imagine
nobel prize that's kosovo
nobody talked about it
nobody treated him worse and he picked her
nobody was able to tell me but i opened it up an executive order
nobody was ever ruder nobody ever suffered like justice kavanaugh suffered in the hands and the mouths of those horrible people
nope
north carolina though
not even close than we were in 2016
not for that but for a lot of things
not lying
not nearly as bad as others
not too good
not where the votes are going to be counted a week later or two weeks later
nothing
now 1024th which meant many many many centuries ago there could have been a hookup somewhere along the line
now he's shot he's got half of his head left and he's out think of it
now he's trying to come back
now i can say anything
now i said that and cnn went 
now it says the president is supposed to fill the seat right
now obama got his the first week
now south carolina we're winning here but south carolina i hate to say this to you i don't want to make you upset
now that we have it they're going like 
now that's called quid pro quo
now then we have some senators that forget it
now they go lobster fishing and fishing
now think of that
now think of that three years three years right
now tomorrow like fake news cnn he was playing games with the united states
now watch the crazy democrats
now watch they'll print this
now we're counting on the federal court system to make it so that we can actually have an evening where we know who wins
now what that's going to do is destroy our country because two things happen
now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for the great people of north carolina
now you're all buying bigger trucks than they ever thought possible
now you're below $2 a lot right
number one we can't afford it
number two everybody is going to come pouring into our country if you do that
obama closed it
obama would go and make a speech and leave that would be it
oh
oh boy he was pathetic but now he's going to try and buy his way back into the democrat party
oh damn it
oh he had a massive crowd
oh he really took a little bit of a shellacking
oh he was okay
oh he's a terrible guy
oh he's given away classified information
oh i don't know v is going to be very hard
oh i never thought of it that way
oh let's not fill the seat

on november 4th it's going to be opened up
on november 4th they'll announce 
once i found out about it it's hard to believe it ever happened
one little glass of water
one little glass of water boom those magnets are gone
one man who especially over the last year he has been so great he couldn't be better
one of the biggest in the world
one of the teachers groups said actually one of the unions and one of the politicians in california said 
one of them said recently that 
one two three there's one back there there's one back there probably oh it's oan thank you oan
one who attempted to murder a police officer and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl 13 members of biden's staff donated to the same fund
or whatever
or would you rather have a man on the supreme court
other countries for the first time in decades respect us again
our allies in many ways treat us worse than our enemies
our allies treat us badly
our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs including 1

she knocked the hell out of bloomberg but she left him sort of alone
she made a great speech right
she said 
she said 
she talked about me too-ing him
she went down like a rock and then she started coming up up up up up
she went out and she took a test
she's very popular
shinzo please do me a favor
shinzo you have to do it

sir now that you've moved we're going to build an embassy in israel in jerusalem
sir we could use an extra generator
sir we have a great piece of land a much better location that we were going to way overpay for a much bigger piece
sir we'll never vote in 2018
sir you don't have to come here
sir you're in idaho
six countries
six to eight were current and we were paying much more than we should have been paying much more
sleepy joe that never gave never took anything or trump misjudging him
so a friend of mine ron baron he's got an office building and he's got jerusalem stone facing the elevators in this high-rise building jerusalem stone
so about a week later the head of boeing called me up
so another months goes by
so article ii of our constitution says the president shall nominate justices of the supreme court
so canada would take our fish and lobster
so does it have to cost so much
so get your friends get your family get your neighbors get your coworkers and get out and vote
so he comes out with a platform no oil
so i called david friedman
so i did that for maine
so i had it included in the price
so i have to make a decision to fill the seat as we say we should have a new campaign
so i said 
so i said 
so i said 
so i said 
so i said 
so i said i love these free polls because pollsters and most of the pollsters are corrupt as far as i'm concerned
so i said to the head of boeing nice guy dennis this was before they had their difficulty which is terrible what happened to them but i said to him 
so i think we ended up spending to fix up the building like $500000
so it's actually more
so it's now election day
so look it's time
so look what they're doing to religion
so many things have happened
so mexico we're driving them a little crazy
so much for free enterprise but he's a great guy he's a friend of mine
so once they did that the only good thing is i can say i said 
so one more time
so thank you very much
so that was about a year and a half into it
so the chant this is a new one
so they asked me the question 
so they didn't pay
so they finally had at 31 years old
so they go to electric catapults that they're working on for years now
so three years it went up $7000 16 years it went up less than $3000
so we are going to have protests against stupidity
so we do all this testing and i come home and i turn on nbc news
so we got listen to this
so we love lou dobbs
so we protect them and they're screwing us on trade
so we took in 130 billion a year going over a three-year period to 400 just because i asked
so we will uphold equal justice under the law for citizens of every race color religion and creed
so we win an election and those are the consequences
so we're going from 130 billion with a b not million to $400 billion
so we're putting i think it should be a woman because i actually like women much more than i like men i have to say
so women and men ready
so would you rather have me choose this is a very scientific poll
so you take one mile square mile multiply times 5000
some did like poland and some others but most didn't
some state supreme court justice just ruled that they can take as long as they want to count the ballots
somebody said 
somebody said 
somebody said 
sometimes in a negotiation when you've given everything and you can't give anymore and then they want more you get up ane walk

that could happen
that could happen that could happen
that doesn't look like we're going to lose michigan
that guy can not be very popular in democrat politics right there
that if a sanctuary city causes problems you can sue the sanctuary city you can sue
that means i'll be leading and winning pennsylvania like we did last time
that means i'm probably the only politician in history
that means less than one
that means the fake news is giving him the questions
that person i think was fired i think was fired
that takes courage
that was 18 minutes
that was 25 years ago
that was actually i think designed to put us out of business literally
that was in prime time
that was not a good lawsuit
that was not a good thing for them to say
that was the first little time
that was the only time he had to ride his bicycle in a race
that would have cost you trillions and trillions of dollars
that's a big area even in an ocean right
that's a big story
that's a big story
that's a commonwealth
that's a good idea
that's a good idea
that's a great one
that's a lot of fake news
that's a lot of money
that's a lot of people
that's a lot of people
that's a lot of press
that's all they're doing
that's amazing
that's another beauty
that's another one that will be controversial
that's as sure as you're there
that's b that's a lot of money
that's classified information
that's fantastic david
that's good
that's hysterical
that's moving along right
that's never been done
that's no way to get into the office because we're going to have a woman president someday but you know what
that's pretty brave because he may have been doing a little drinking but he was known for that right
that's really we have a great country
that's right
that's the key i don't ever want to use them
that's the problem nothing's ever been done
that's the real deal
that's too bad but we have sleepy joe we'll see how that works out
that's true
that's what it means
that's why i say everything we do is a protest
that's xenophobic
the answer is yes when the other side cheats
the army the navy the air force the marines the coast guard they're so good
the bad news for the democrats is we are more enthusiastic now
the biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy your country
the camera starts to shake a little bit and you know there's another thing
the congressmen
the first question he was destroyed
the floods are big
the floors of the forest it's got 20 years of leaves and trees that are dry as a bone matchsticks
the free airwaves they lie over the free airwaves
the governor's got it just shut down nice and tight
the likes of which no country has ever seen before
the n1h1
the new one is totally different 747
the next day it was like one of the biggest selling t shirts where is hunter
the one who treated him worst was kamala
the only competitor is europe
the people in certain groups are trying to hold them up as long as possible as long as possible
the polls in texas have closed
the price is too high
the red lights just went off
the single greatest campaign in history if he wins but you know what
the sleepy campaign has joined forces with those trying to tear down america and our way of life
the smartest is i won't tell you
the storm is big
the supreme court was a very central issue in both the 2016 presidential election and then the 2018 midterm elections where by the way i didn't run
the ventilators the vaccines the therapeutics now we have look at what's happening
the way he was tortured was disgraced
the winging speeches are the best ones like last night
the worst i think i think there was one he was in ohio and he said he was in florida right
their senator never did it for them
then he went 
then he went 
then he went to china he got $1
then i got the tariffs
then she totally destroyed mike bloomberg
then the great lou dobbs said 
then there was a fourth and a fifth and a sixth
then they announced the second they called it 
then we got lightweights that i fired and they write books about me that i'm a bad guy 
then we win the election it's like they're all in shock
then you have cases
there is no source
there was no social distancing tom tillis
there was nobody
there'll be no oil there'll be no god there'll be no guns
there's a lot of time
there's another beauty
there's no provision
there's nobody like him
these are all things that he said
these are most incredible people
these little deals that we have here come on in folks come on in
these people are crazy
these people are sick
these people know exactly what i'm talking about
these states everything's closed except you're allowed to protest
they are fantastic people
they are so envious of what we're doing
they called it a monument right
they can't even believe it
they choke they gag they can't breathe
they couldn't do business in european union they couldn't do business in china because they were charging tariffs to maine
they did a lot
they didn't choke
they didn't for them
they didn't know what the hell they were doing
they do
they don't like my foreign policy
they don't like trump too much
they don't report that right
they don't report that story
they don't talk about that
they don't want it
they don't want to give us the credit for these big crowds because you know what
they don't want to use steam
they filled up
they give him a big fat shot in the ass and he comes out and for two hours he's better than ever before
they go up up up up
they got so much we don't know what to do with it
they got them out
they had more crap on that helmet with night goggles
they hate it when i say it but you know honestly they are the enemy of the people
they have 1
they have a brand new one
they have the best in the world
they helped it a lot
they just didn't
they just made it up
they keep him from talking
they like guns right in texas
they lined up they went down there was no social distancing in between these great tough guys
they made a mistake for us
they made it up
they make it up and then they put it in ads
they make up phony stories
they never cover it
they never do it
they ought to do some forest management a little bit maybe
they respect us again
they respect us again
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said the other night 
they say 
they settled by saying 
they should have gotten more
they should have gotten more money
they should have no matter what you do
they should pay a lot of money for this
they sit behind their desk
they spend fortunes on public relations and then i get up and make a speech like this with television blazing all over the world i guess
they stopped it from going into the rest of china should have been stopped in china
they take advantage of us
they think this is better
they thought it was okay
they took the word 
they use free airwaves and then they give you fake news
they use them and they lie
they walk out that's to me even better but ultimately long-term those vaccines are going to be great and they're really working out well and it's going to be really soon
they want law and order
they want to get rid of the second amendment
they want to keep it going as long as possible
they went down and they had $250000 outfits
they went down they never had to stop
they were going to buy air force one 5
they were in the middle of an airport that nobody ever heard of
they were saying that women in the suburbs they're not sure if they like me
they were screaming at the wrong people
they were shouting at them screaming at them
they will make up a lie
they will make up a lie they will make up a story and they go with it it makes no difference whether or not it's show and they'll take ads
they will tell you these incredible women up here from north carolina
they'd been doing it for hundreds of years frankly under different names
they'll go 
they'll say 
they'll say 
they're a bunch of scoundrels
they're corrupt
they're getting hit by it
they're going to be running him ragged
they're going to confiscate your guns second amendment's going to be destroyed

they're going to move probably to the great state of texas
they're going to put up $5 million give it to the united states
they're going to say 
they're going to take it away from him
they're going to try and get sleepy joe the credit
they're going to try and give sleepy joe the credit
they're lucky he's a friend of mine
they're moving to the united states unbelievable company
they're okay
they're paying 1% they're supposed to pay two and 2% is way too low
they're serving as police and they've done a great job
they're serving as policemen
they're so stupid so stupid
they're staggering
they're starting to like me a lot lately because it's law and order
they're the best we've ever had
they're very weak compared to some of the foreign people that we deal with from foreign countries leaders of foreign countries
they're waiting to see what's coming over the next few months in terms of therapeutics which to me is even more important than the vaccine
they've been killing each other for so many they're going to stop killing
they've had the best year they ever had
think of it
think of it
think of it
think of it even pocahontas treated him better
think of it i won't say it
think of it you want to get a vaccine and they're willing to hurt people let people die for political reasons
think of that
this by itself would be a big achievement
this can only happen in north carolina
this can only happen to me

you got thousands of people behind these people
you got to build an extra generator
you got to do it
you got to finish it
you got to pay
you got to pay
you got to pay your bills
you got to put up $5 million either to the treasury of the united states maybe or into some education fund or do something
you got to spend more than that
you got to take care of our law enforcement
you had the best year you've ever had
you have good husbands
you have stands in front
you have to be able to answer
you have to see what we've done with nasa

you see the enthusiasm that we have
you see what's happening
you think it's been easy
you were targeted

100000 people a year die from what comes across our souther border and we can get the democrats to help us in sealing it even tighter
18 sites of confliction they were behind every one of them in the middle east
180 million people will lose with what they want to do
28 times remember 28 times they counted them and there's much more than that i would imagine that you can choose your plan you can choose your doctor
5 years then we have as a group in america
8 billion dollars in cash
8 billion dollars in cash and we got taken to the cleaners so i terminated the deal
8 billion in cash
a doctor in the house please

a lot of illegal voting going on out there by the way a lot of illegal voting
a man who's really been stepping up to the front
a vote for any democrat in 2020 and a vote for any democrat tomorrow in north carolina is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and a destruction of the american dream
above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one america we'll be one united nation
admiral how good are the new coast guard cutters
all of them help

and by the way we're building that wall and it's going up very big
and dan bishop greg murphy these guys they're going to protect your second amendment
and do you know what the biggest excuse is when i go to them and i'll say 
and ever one of them said 
and every time i meet a foreign leader almost every time they say 
and everybody respects him and everybody likes him
and for all of these crazy people but they're not so crazy they know what they're doing that talk about russia russia russia
and for the first time i like this guy
and he goes 
and he's become a special friend
and hello to fayetteville
and here in north carolina over 230000 more people now have jobs and small business formation has skyrocketed by more than 25%
and hold them accountable for the lives that they've shattered
and hopefully it'll all work out
and i also approved for israel the golan heights and if you really think about it i said to people 
and i also got other nato members to pay an additional 100 billion dollars over the last year and a half that they weren't paying they were delinquent
and i believe he's here tonight
and i guarantee you one thing none of these democrats whether it's pocahontas or sleepy joe none of them would be able to do a thing about it and nobody would ever think of helping the farmers who have been targeted by china
and i like him and we used to fight like hell right
and i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem which every president said they would do
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i said we're not going to do it 150 billion dollars president obama paid and 1
and i want china to do well and i hope they do well but they've had now the worst year in 57 years
and i want to thank our new secretary of defense mark esper for the job he's done and he views it really as a national security threat and you have to
and i will say north carolina in our country probably got hit the hardest
and i've said it and i say it loudly and proudly i don't believe there's been any president or any administration that has done more in 2
and it wasn't easy but i was helped by lindsey and a lot of great people
and kevin i want to thank you because that was a great job you did on that one
and ladies and gentlemen of north carolina the best is yet to come
and once it does it's going to be very hard for them to destroy what we've done
and ours was going like this we were defending many countries that treat us very badly on trade and very unfairly
and out of the tens of billions of dollars that we've taken in because of the fact that our great american patriot farmers have been targeted by china they've been targeted because they know the farmer is like trump
and said sonny 
and so many things are happening and we did right to try
and that's where we're working it also with mexico and canada to give them some of the games
and that's why we need dan bishop and greg murphy
and the labor force participation rate for women is at the highest level now in 15 years and soon will be 35 years and soon i promise will probably end up being better than ever
and the unemployment rate for african-americans just reached another brand new yesterday all time low in the history of our country
and then i read where obama is more popular in germany than trump
and then they were forcing you to buy light bulbs that cost a fortune so i signed something a couple days ago that gives you the right to continue to use the incandescent light bulbs i don't know about you much less expensive lights that are beaming down over us
and there is a big danger in fact they have labels don't break this bulb
and they had old broken equipment that they had to keep going on a shoestring
and they tried to do the recession thing
and they want to take away your private healthcare your private insurance
and they want to turn off the cameras
and they're going 
and they've been trying to get this for 45 years
and we also passed va accountability on behalf of our great veterans
and we are going to keep on winning winning winning we're going to keep on winning
and we have a man from north carolina who loves this state
and we have tremendous potential upward and china wants to talk
and we made that up
and we put screens outside for all of the people
and we will live by the words of our national motto in god we trust it'll stay there
and we will make america great again
and we're going to try to get that done
and what we've done for them and for religion is so important
and when i say 
and when people wait two or three days to come in and especially these first rows i just want to tell you we really thank you
and who knows could have been elsewhere
and you have democrat named dan mccready and he wants open borders
and you know budgets are fine i love budgets and we will get to that don't worry about it
and you know what
and you'll be back sooner then anybody ever thought and it'll be better then ever
and you'll save 3500 dollars think of that
appreciate it leader
as an example hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs and china is eating the cost which the fake news doesn't want to tell you
as an example mexico i must say they've really helped us at the border
as an example we're trying to get the car companies going to give them a little bit of extra energy and they will be able to build a car that consumers can buy which will be better than the car they make today
as long as i'm your president i will never ever let democrats take away your healthcare and give it away free to people that have entered our country illegally
at the center of the american drug crisis is the border crisis
because i say to them 
because you've always done it
bob kraft helped me with the new england patriots people
boy would i like to put you on television i'll tell you right now and they can't turn off those cameras fast enough but they say to the farmers 
breaking news donald trump hates people
but a man who's done an incredible job in washington took over a rough situation and he's become a real leader and that's republican leader kevin mccarthy
but all of that is changed
but he knew it all the time devin nunez
but how good a coach in all fairness here is coach belichick
but i can say this 2020 is essentially just as important because they'll try and take it away
but i can tell you they'd like to get back to business because they're not doing very well
but i knew it was going to happen because we go out and we see these rallies the likes of which no one has ever seen before ever ever ever in politics ever in politics
but i was willing to do it i would've taken it
but in my first week in office i proudly withdrew from that job destroying tpp catastrophe and we're replacing one of the worst trade deals ever made by any country
but it's a rough job and they get so little praise for the job that they do
but it's never been so far left
but nobody's ever asked us to do that before
but now you finally have a president who understands that i'm not supposed to be the president of the world i'm supposed to be the president of the united states of america
but one of the biggest issues in this election is in fact sanctuary cities
but our country could fix it so easy if the democrats would sit with me for 15 minutes but they don't want to do that because they want to have open borders
but the radical democrats want to dismantle demolish and destroy everything that you've gained and they will do it and it won't take that long
but they can do it
but they said that if the bulb break it's considered almost like the waste site
but thom tillis has really worked with us over the last period of time
but to pass the bill we need more republicans
but we actually have the world cup it's the biggest sporting event in the world and we got it
but we are going to achieve new breakthroughs in science medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending within 10 years the aids epidemic in america
but we don't fight anymore
but we had a different location as you all know and we said 
but we had a phrase make what
but we had to rebuild our military was totally depleted it was totally depleted
but we won one of the greatest elections in history and because of that and you would be in big trouble if we didn't i can tell you that
but you know somebody told me that as you know they're much more expensive bulbs than for what you save
but you know we've created six million new jobs since election day and i couldn't say that in my initial rallies because nobody would have believed it
but you know what
but you know what their answer is
by the way i have about 10 women in the front row and you come from north carolina and they travel all over the place
can you believe it
can you imagine
china has taken advantage of our country for decades decades
china made $500 billion over the last number of years on a yearly basis they steal our intellectual property
china's lost three million jobs thousands of companies are leaving china the supply chain is crumbling because they can't pay the tariffs and our country has taken over things that you would've never thought
civil service made it almost impossible
come
come on up dan
come on up greg
come on up greg
come up
come up greg
congratulations on what you've done with the economy
criminal cartel smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across our souther border including heroin meth cocaine and fentanyl
dan bishop everyone
dan come on up
david rouzer
david thank you
democrats also want to bring in unlimited numbers of foreign refugees from overseas all at the expense of supporting their own communities
democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion and socialism
devin nunez
diamond and silk
did don junior give a good speech
do they love mark meadows
doctor in the house
doing better
don't forget we are doing this and still fighting the unfairness of china and other countries on trade
every day they're making good on the motto 
every major democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would raid medicare force private doctors out of medicine and lead to the rationing of life saving treatments
everyone said 
explain it
first of all nobody else ever had tens of billions of dollars pouring in from china because it's always been the other way around
for decades our leaders put global interest and special interest ahead of your interest
for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
get out
get out and vote
get out there and vote for those two guys
get the heck out
go ahead
go ahead
go into the neighborhood
go out and vote tomorrow for dan bishop please
good
good
good luck tomorrow greg
great job
great job
great people
greg murphy
greg murphy come on up for a second here
he defended justice kavanaugh when he was treated so badly
he did things that no ones ever done before
he does such a great job
he doesn't
he doesn't know what it is not to fight
he fights so hard
he goes 
he loves this country
he loves this party and he loves your state lives here louis dejoy
he loves us
he means it too
he said 
he said 
he said 
he used to call me something else
he wants an extra term ladies and gentlemen
he wants sanctuary cities
he wants to see dan and greg win so badly
he was on fire
he was out there when it wasn't in vogue to be saying that comey was a stone cold liar and leaker
he was talking after the baby is born the doctor will talk to the mother and they'll make the decision as to whether or not that baby lives
he's a wonderful guy
he's been a great champ thank you greg
he's done a fantastic job
he's got an organization samaritan's purse based right here in north carolina and the work that franklin and his family and all of those that are with franklin graham we want to thank them
he's got to be i'm making people pay their bills he's got to be
he's great
he's great
he's hated me for 20 years and i've hated him also
he's not going to protect your second amendment
he's recently introduced a bill to give american victims the right to sue sanctuary cities
hello fayetteville
hold up your hands
honestly you're doing a great job but also if this radical left gets in they're going to take away everything and they're going to destroy our country
how about devin
how did that happen
how do you lose that debate
how good is he
how many is this
how many rallies have you come too
i also want to give a special recognition to the many non-governmental organizations doing so much to help people recover from dorian in particular franklin graham
i always have to preface it because there'll be headlines trump didn't tell the truth
i always say 
i can leave right now
i can say 
i can tell you that
i can tell you the unemployment numbers for women are the best they've been now in 72 years
i can't be certain that many but it's a lot okay
i didn't do it
i don't know if it looks good being out of your district
i don't think so
i don't want to forget it some of the wealthiest countries in the world
i got it done
i guess dan's speech wasn't so good
i heard that
i hope he doesn't do this or that
i just came in
i just set a certain path
i know you people so well
i know you want to be cool but he's pretty good
i love that name
i love the farmers
i mean i go out and sometimes i'll get these huge audiences and i wish we could've gotten a large arena than this
i never liked this guy and i see him in the white house and i say 
i promise i won't break it all the new ones
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i see it all the time where some of the networks that are crazy they have a group of farmers in some cases they have groups of women they say 
i see them so much and i must say they have other things to do
i stood in the white house with the first lady that first night and i said 
i think they should
i told a story the other day about a business man i saw one of the biggest in the country
i want to thank you both
i was even willing to stand out in the rain and get my hair soaking wet but they said it was a little bit out of your district and i said 
i was saying this when i was a private citizen
i withdrew it and we put sanctions all over the place and they're a much different country and let's see what happens
i won't mention names because i don't want to embarrass anybody
i wonder why
i wonder why
i would have been very proud to have done it
i wouldn't mind fighting the democrats but we really have to look at it as a two-some
i'm actually more impressed with that number than 150 billion dollars you want to know the truth
i'm leaving right now
i'm not interested
i'm sorry i didn't make it historic
i'm too busy
i'm using the words great state
i've just come from a meeting with north carolina officials representing communities hit by hurricane dorian and i expressed the unwavering solidarity of the american people we are behind you 100%
i've never seen anything like the treatment that justice kavanaugh received
if a person is sick and maybe terminally ill why aren't we letting them try this new technology
in august mccready said it was 
in fact we are keeping even more promises by far than we made or than we promised
in hundred dollar bills it's a lot
in just over two years we've taken this big beautiful ship and it's being turned around very quickly
including two great new supreme court justices
incredible
incredible
incredible job
incredible people
incredible the strides that we have made
it didn't work out that way did it
it looks like he's in good shape but you've got to get it out
it was $12 billion and it was $16 billion and out of the tariffs that we've taken in we gave to our farmers for distribution hopefully very good distribution hopefully very even distribution we've given them $28 billion so that they're whole
it was 16 billion and the year before 12
it was a very special day
it was an incredible day an incredible month an incredible year and i don't know that you can ever compare anything to it
it will be safer it will be better you can save 3500 dollars it will be less costly
it would've been even worse than nafta and we know how bad nafta was
it would've shown it's my real hair at least
it wouldn't be pretty but it's my hair
it'll be amazing what we can do for our country
it'll be historic very soon
it's a disaster
it's a tremendous incentive to come in
it's about your family your future and the fate of your country
it's also why we need four more years
it's bigger
it's called va accountability
it's costing us billions of dollars to protect these wealthy
it's crazy what's happening
it's going to be historic very soon
it's gotta develop those roots
it's great for everybody
it's great to be here in north carolina's ninth congressional district with the hardworking patriots who believe in faith family god and country
it's like did you ever really feel where you don't even have to treat people nicely
it's one and the same
it's really amazing what's going on out there but after years of building up there countries we are finally building up our country that's the bottom line
it's ridiculous and we're coming up with lindsey graham and all of the folks we're coming up with a great healthcare plan that if we take back to the house
it's so perfectly done it's so the way it was
it's the media and the democrats
it's true it's not about me it's about you
it's very big the bulbs the new bulbs they're very dangerous with all of the gases
just for a second
just recently mecklenburg county set free an illegal alien charged with first-degree rape and crimes against a child
justice neil gorsuch and justice brett cavanaugh who they put through hell
keep america great
kevin
kevin's working so hard for so many different people
king president prime minister queen
king you got to pay
last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in nearly 31 years
let me see
let's do this one
let's not even talk about it
let's not even talk about it
little statements that are a little bit sort of not too good huh
look at what's happening to democrat-run cities every single one of them
made in america or made in the usa
make america great again the best
many many times many many times
mark helped so much
mark meadows
may not be great but i will say it's better than most of my friends who are the same age
maybe her
maybe him maybe her right
maybe one of the biggest things is within about a month we'll have close to 180 federal judges including the public division judges
maybe we could skip north carolina today sir
mccready supports sanctuary city policies that force prisons and jails to release criminal aliens directly into your neighborhoods
more americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country
mr
mr
mr
mr
murder
my administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you
my family loves this country and two people from your state that the first lady before she was first lady she said 
my son loves this country
nah
nearly 600000 americans entered the labor force last month alone
neither sir
no doubt about it
no matter what i say you know what they say
no no i'm only kidding i'm only kidding
no no no
no president no longer how long they serve has gotten anywhere even close to what we've done with regulations and that's one of the reasons our economy is so good
no thank you
no thank you
nobody thought this would happen
nobody would do that
nobody would ever do that
nobody would ever do that i can tell you that right now and our farmers know we have to fight
north carolina i've had it with you
north carolina will truly recover so fast
not going to happen we can't do it and we have many other countries also but we'll worry about them a little bit later
not under the usmca
now take a million dollars and make it 1
now they're going to go out tomorrow 
now we are within moments hopefully of having despite what you heard a few weeks ago where we were heading
now we still have a year and a half little bit less can you believe it
now we're finally making immensely wealthy countries pay the cost of their defense we're negotiating with a lot of them
now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of north carolina
number one anywhere in the world
obamacare and we're keeping obamacare alive
oh gee
oh they're going crazy
okay
okay
okay i think we know that answer
one of the most successful people
or 
or 
or get your votes in early
our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 51 years
our evangelicals are here tonight and they're all over the place
our first task is a giant victory
our great republican candidate dan bishop will fight with everything he has to stop sanctuary cities and defend the people of this great state
our lieutenant governor who is going to be i think a highly competitive candidate for a very important race dan forest
our shared republican agenda is pro-worker pro-jobs pro-family pro-growth and 100% pro-american
people have been standing outside for two days to get in so this happens
please
please please let there be a recession please
plenty of others they've taken advantage of our country like you wouldn't believe and i've been saying this for many years
president
president
president
president i'm fighting for your victory
president you've got to pay
prime minister you got to pay
promise made promises kept
put one of these crazy people running our country again
really incredible people
remember i used to say 
remember president obama
representative david rouzer
republicans no matter what you do where you are we want people to obey our laws
rick
right
right to try
right to try
right to try it's called
ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up to the moment of birth and if you look at the governor of virginia he was even talking about essentially you would say an execution
russia's not too happy about that
rutherford county
see now he calls me mr
senator lindsay graham
serious wall
she'll have tremendous democrat support
six million new jobs
so dangerous
so greg murphy is looking to like dan cut your taxes defend your second amendment support our policies really really support our military and our veterans
so how do you feel about having them released hardened horrible criminals into rutherford county
so i always say kiddingly 
so i said 
so i want to introduce thom tillis and i want to introduce greg murphy
so i've always got to be extremely cautious
so if you want to stop the drug smugglers the human traffickers the viscous ms13 gang members and by the way thank you to ice
so important
so importantly more than 70 million americans have been lifted off of food stamps
so in 2016 we had in my opinion the greatest phrase in the history of politics make america great again
so many
so many more
so many more
so many more
so many other things
so now it's just different and now it's working the other way and tariffs are a beautiful thing when you know how to use them they're a beautiful thing
so that they're whole
so they targeted the farmers and i said to sonny perdue secretary of agriculture 
so they're not exactly happy
so we end up with closed factories no jobs no taxes no nothing and these other countries gain
so we're doing it a different way and mexico is now patrolling with 27000 troops
so we're stopping them so we don't even have to worry about court
so we're taking in billions and billions but i've got 100 billion dollars and the secretary general of nato stoltenberg is my biggest fan
so we've done a good job all of us together as a movement we've done a great job for israel
so we've had great support over the last six months in particular from a man who happens to be your senator right now and we need him to keep going because he has been fantastic
so whatever you do start talking to your people we need a vote on the usmca
so when your great and honored veterans are waiting in line for three weeks four weeks five days 10 days two months they go to a private doctor we pay for the bill and they get themselves taken care of instead of dying which was happening
so you can hopefully buy the new ones but you can buy the old ones too and you can save a lot of money and you could even look better
sometimes through adversity things work out better
sonny how much was it last year and the year before
special great people
support for sanctuary cities is disloyalty to american citizens and mccready wants sanctuary cities with all of their protections for people that are serious criminals
take your time
take your time
take your time
take your time please
tell me
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you and vice president mike pence thank you very much
thank you dan
thank you dan
thank you doctor
thank you doctor
thank you doctor
thank you everybody
thank you everybody
thank you everybody
thank you fellows
thank you for being here
thank you franklin
thank you law enforcement
thank you mark
thank you north carolina
thank you sir
thank you thom and thank you greg
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you very much dan
thank you very much for being here
thank you what a job and they're doing very well i have to tell you that
that didn't work
that guy would
that i can tell you
that means when they treat our veterans and they wouldn't have done it in primetime i can tell you but when they treat our sick and trouble veterans badly we can say 
that was a good job
that was a good job
that was a great job thank you kevin mccarthy
that was a little bit of a surprise but i know one thing about north carolina
that's a big deal
that's a good idea
that's a lot of rallies and it all emanates from this area
that's another one we've been trying and in all fairness the unions made it very tough
that's good
that's good
that's great
that's great
that's not a great answer
that's really great
that's really great
that's right
that's shocking to hear that but we can do it we're going to do it definitely
that's so great
that's the amount i asked sonny i said sonny 
that's the bedroom of abraham lincoln
that's the only excuse
that's united states mexico and canada and they've already voted
that's what we did in 2016 they came from the hills and valleys they came from the cities they came from all over the place and people were saying these fakers back there they were saying 
that's why dan and greg if we take back the house if we keep the senate and maybe even increase it a little bit wouldn't be bad and on the assumption we keep the presidency you're going to have great healthcare
that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
the 10 women
the best numbers we've ever had and by the way african-american youth unemployment has also reached the lowest level ever recorded in history
the big story they like him more in europe than they like trump
the charges against these freed criminals includes sexual assault robbery drug crimes kidnapping and homicide
the deductibles are through the roof
the democrat party has never been farther outside of the mainstream
the democrats will not doing anything about these horrible open loopholes which would be so good
the fake news
the fake news right
the farmers want it the unions want it the manufacturers want it and by the way 600000 manufacturing jobs in this country remember
the future belongs to you
the insurance companies and the drug companies were very unsure
the last administration with biden and obama at the helm they tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals that ever been negotiated the transpacific partnership
the media and their partner the democrats
the people of the united states did it
the prayers of our entire nation are with the citizens of north carolina south carolina georgia florida and everyone else that was in the storms path and i will say i was called by the government of the bahamas and we're helping with the bahamas
the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and the american dream
the results have been unbelievable
the russian hoax was a pure hoax you saw that with comey the other day
the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world
the weather wasn't so great to be traveling today and they said 
their primary source of income is oil and gas and now we're bigger than russia bigger than saudi arabia
then we'll get back to business
there aren't too many people in this room that want to do it for a living
there's always time for the other but we had to do it
these are great women
these are many killers in those gangs and we're taking them out of our country by the thousands ms13
these are vicious vicious people
these people go into those nests we call them nets
they all said 
they are incredible
they are unfortunately not the best people
they can't count
they go crazy but with the farmers you know that
they got it mark
they have a good a coach whether you like it or not and i know you north carolina
they have brand new coast guard cutters
they just keep coming at you in waves
they look rich as hell to me i don't know
they love the country they love you
they respect america
they said 
they said all of them except for two
they take our jobs they make our product they sell the product into our country with no tax no nothing
they traded away your factories sold your future squandered your tax dollars sacrificed your security and bogged us down in one foreign debacle after another
they tried many other things
they want it and we want it and it's great for the farmers
they want to have drugs pouring into our country
they want to talk
they were hit so hard
they were hit so hard
they'll say 
they're all saying 
they're going to be coming to the united states in two or three weeks and we'll see what happens but unless we're going to make a good deal or a fair deal for our country let's face it we can not go back to a situation
they're not going to win the election
they're not working too well
they're pushing a little hard and it's not working
they're so great they're so smart
they're socialists
they're terrific
they're the finest in the world sir
they're trying and they're trying put out little statements
they're willing to give up their results because they think it will help them win the election
they've never had two troops steward our border and you saw the numbers today were down approximately 57%
they've taken advantage of us for years and i have to say sadly in many cases it's our allies that took the greatest advantage of this country
things that we've never even talked about we're getting done
think of it we have these immensely wealthy countries and they're paying for a fraction of our cost to defend them
think of that
think what happens when it all gets fixed we have ourselves a country that's going to be so strong
this has been going on for many years
this is a radical democrat idea
this is the real deal
this state should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans not for criminal aliens
this whole thing with sanctuary cities and you go to california which is so many sanctuary cities they don't know what's happening out there
thousands and thousands of people who couldn't get in
to bring back our jobs for other countries we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in american history
to protect america's security i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal
to protect your family you must defeat open borders
to stop the far left you must vote in tomorrow's special election
together we will lift millions more from our horrible horrible situations that have developed over the years
together we will make america wealthy again
tom brady had a pretty good game the other night right
tomorrow is the election and you'll get out

we're keeping it and running it as well as it can but the premiums are too high
we're rebuilding our military defending our sovereignty and reclaiming our dignity as a nation
we're respected again
we're setting new records and we're fighting trade deals and we're fighting military deals that are unfair to our country
we're supposed to protect them and they don't pay i say you can't do that
we're talking now
we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many more terrific republican leaders
we're with him all the way
we've changed things but it's gotta grow
we've changed things right
we've cut a record number of job killing regulations
we've got a great relationship with the world cup it's a big deal
we've got plenty of time
we've got to do this and i don't know
we've got to fight them more than anybody else
we've rebuilt our military we've taken care of the great people that work in our military
well at least you won't have to travel so far for this one right
well every inch of wall that we put up is vital and we're putting up miles and miles and we intend by next year at the end of the year to have anywhere between 400 and 500 miles of wall built and this is serious wall
well he's fighting
well i don't know i don't know
well i'm saying if we continue that production they can buy whatever they want to buy but it can really save a tremendous amount of money and even have a light that's better
well now you have the best unemployment numbers employment and unemployment numbers that you've ever had as african-americans as asian-americans as hispanic-americans
well that's good but the big thing is tomorrow
well then he said 
well wait a minute under the normal rules i will be out in 2024 so we may have to go for an extra term
well we appreciate it
well we did it but we've got to get usmca put up for a vote by the democrats
what a job you've done
what are you doing here
what are you going to do
what can be much more threatening that people that want to pour across our borders and we have the worst walls we have the weakest walls in the history of any country
what do you do you're going to throw it away
what do you like better made in america made in the usa
what do you think
what do you think of president trump
what do you think of president trump
what happens when that gets fixed and other things get fixed
what is it
what is the word we want to use
what the hell is happening
what you've done in iran is more important than both of them
what's more important the golan heights or the capital of jerusalem by moving our embassy there
what's the amount they've took our of our farmers
what's the point
when i came into office iran was a real terror
when you add it all up nobody's done what we have
whether it has to do with religion
who would believe it
who would do that
who would think of getting 12 billion plus 16 million $28 billion because they've been targeted
whoever saw a million dollars piled up as a promotion
why are we defending you
why are we protecting you mr
why do you have to lose
why would we do this
why would you do it
why would you do it
with the support and encouragement of mccready sanctuary jurisdictions in north carolina have released thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into your communities and you see it
with your help we will elect for republicans to congress to create a safe modern fair and lawful system of immigration
with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and i'd like to fight a little less with these people but they just don't stop
wow look at this
you can go back as far as you want nafta the disaster of nafta
you can take it and you'll build it quickly and you'll build it beautifully
you can't do anything to stop them
you can't do that anymore
you can't do that you got to pay nato
you catch them and then you have to release them and they're suppose to come back to court in the next three four fix six years and nobody shows up and democrats don't want to fix it
you could've kissed many of your industries goodbye
you don't have any choice you have to vote for me
you draw up an agreement taking away liability
you ever see that
you got to be kidding
you got to go out and vote
you have people that want to get ride of those sanctuary cities they just aren't able to do it with the people that get elected
you have program catch and release
you have to be a fighter or you're not going to be here very long
you have to have a wall and you have to stop it and when you look at what's happening with human trafficking and it's mostly women they traffic in women and they pour through our borders
you have to see this
you have to watch them
you haven't seen outside
you know
you know george washington had a great election too
you know i guess you're right when you think about it
you know that better than anybody and this state knows it better than anybody
you know the day that i'm more popular than him i'm not doing my job
you know there are two people that are unbelievable
you know they tried the russia thing
you know what their biggest thing is
you know what we did with respect to people that are very sick or terminally ill right
you know what you do
you know who i'm talking about
you listen to some of them
you must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing thing you
you probably know his name
you see it
you voted for president trump are you happy
you want made in america i don't care what do you like better
you want made in america then made in the usa
you want people that are going to help our country
you would need a magic wand
you're all screaming 
you're fired
you're immensely wealthy you compete with us on trade
you're never going to get it done
you're sort of right about that
you've got to watch them
18 years ago there was a rally held by somebody and we heard the words from two people that ‘we love you sir
200
200
200
32000 people
47 years of bad votes
5 trillion in the us military
6 million michigan jobs and over 128000 michigan businesses
8 billion in cash
8 billion in cash
99
a lot of people didn't know it
a lot of people forget that
a lot of what i did is destroy some of the horrible things that they did including regulations all over the place
a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs and a limitless future for all americans instead of letting washington change us despite all that we have been through we are changing washington
about a day after i got back i said 
adam schiff said 
after learning about him with his incredible career and helicopter and he's a great and actually a great flyer i heard the other day a great one a really good one as opposed to those that aren't so good but his incredible background and education at west point and all of the things he did
after the last administration nearly killed the us auto industry i saved the us auto industry
again he took the manifesto drawn up by bernie and the super lips and that's what he's going by including a massive increase in your taxes and a total assault on your second amendment
all i know is we're not in war and that's okay
all made in the usa
all made in the usa by the way
all of those great generals all of those great admirals our great vice president mike pence they did a fantastic job
all right
all right
all right i'll do it one more time but that's it
all the plants that have been built are being built and what about the plants that are being expanded
also 10% at 12% all different tariffs
also with us are some other great candidates and people that are going to do a tremendous job helping our congressman
also with you is rnc chairwoman
always that's the nicest
america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
and also you have to have a governor because right now michigan's lagging
and by the way many other things in michigan
and by the way on wednesday i believe of next week prime minister benjamin netanyahu and as you know the country a very powerful very respected country with a great leader the uae is coming to the white house and we're going to sign an agreement that hasn't been signed in many decades
and by the way the us marshals went in to get the killer and that was the end of that
and by the way we're pulling back and we're doing everything so beautifully
and eric essahki
and frankly and i mean this if he had more support from the republican party he would've won that race
and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs at a level like you've never seen before
and i don't know if you saw it but during the democrat national convention and caucus they took twice i thought i was sort of maybe they made a mistake you saw that they took the word god out of the pledge of allegiance twice
and i endorsed him and he went like a rocket ship
and i got rid of it
and i hope they're not leaving michigan out because it's never the same if they do
and i hope you know like in minneapolis we were asked to come in we went in we took care of that problem in about what 30 minutes
and i really believe you're going to make it
and i said 
and i talked about him a little while before i could talk about him all night
and i think they do it for political reasons because there'll be less activity
and i used to say 
and i was starting to get calls and then all of a sudden we saw the plague pour in and we saw what was happening and it really stopped things
and i'll be honest with you john
and i'm going to remember michigan
and if you look at what we just did in wisconsin which was so amazing three days and we went in
and it was
and it's been amazing what's happened in michigan
and it's incredible they said with all the years that they've been covering presidential elections they've never heard that chant that 
and look no president has done for michigan what president trump has done for michigan
and now joe biden is once again hurting innocent people with his dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracy theories putting millions of lives around the world at risk
and our farmers are doing great
and somebody's doing a fantastic job and tells us we're really pretty far ahead
and that was his decision
and that's exactly right i won't allow it to happen
and that's what they did in the past to other presidents
and the governors have a lot of power over that
and the only reason he's doing that is he knows we're right next to having a vaccine
and the word got out
and then they said 
and then they'll say 
and then we had to say 
and they didn't touch it
and this is said by one of the guy's that got us into the war in iraq got us into the middle east
and this is what he has
and tim walberg
and we are going to keep on winning winning winning we are going to keep on winning
and we cheered as we looked at all of the success that we've had but he really oversaw the rise of china as a positive development
and we did
and we did and now we're coming back strong but success brings us together and it was happening and then we got that terrible situation happened and we'll never forget it
and we didn't
and we didn't
and we ended it
and we have a good relationship with kim jong-un
and we have systems and missiles and rockets and military and tech
and we were going to go into seattle
and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in god we trust
and we will maintain peace through strength
and we will make america great again
and we won't be depleted from fighting in all these ridiculous locations all over the globe
and we're expanding our autos now our cars and we're doing a great job of it and i want to thank everybody
and we're still getting those big tariffs
and you're going to remember that
and you're guaranteed to win
and you're lucky i'm here because you're second amendment would be gone if i wasn't
anybody
appreciate it
as he came to the white house two weeks ago
as i said we've already built over 310 miles of border wall
as president i will always support the heroes of law enforcement
as the british government advised the british people in the face of world war ii 
at 200 you have no choice
at no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties two visions two philosophies and two agendas for the future
at the end i felt embarrassed i said 
because they don't love the country
before me china never paid anything
before the end of the year we will have a safe and effective vaccine and we will defeat the china virus
before the plague came in from china we will coming together
before the virus my administration added over 200 new auto and auto parts plants
bernie
biden and his party tried to lock law-abiding americans into their homes while they encourage rioters and vandals rampaging through in all cases democrat-run cities
biden championed nafta perhaps the worst trade deal in the history of our country
biden has vowed to remove these tariffs and allow china to resume its pillaging
biden is waging war against the american middle class
biden opposes school choice and has stated that if he's elected charter schools so important are gone
biden says he wants to protect black lives but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of young african american citizens
biden supported china's entry into the world trade organization which by the way was a disaster
biden supported every disastrous globalist sellout for over a half a century including nafta china and dpp
biden supported the outrageous fuel economy standards that have hammered the auto industry and i reversed that rule
biden took a sledgehammer to your state earlier this year i kept my promise to michigan workers when we ended the nafta nightmare that everybody said was impossible to end and when we signed that brand new us mexico-canada agreement into law
biden was willing to sacrifice american lives on the altar of open borders
boy have we hurt the elite haven't we now
boy oh boy
boy oh boy she'll be great
but do you remember how bad it was just before i took office
but he gave away so much
but he said 
but he said 
but honestly it's been amazing what's happened in ohio and north carolina and south carolina and florida and new hampshire and so many other places
but how they're all leaving and going to mexico and canada
but i have the distinct pleasure of running against the worst presidential candidate in the history of presidential politics
but i realize now why it was an effort because as soon as i got in i was lobbied by everybody 
but i wouldn't worry about it because he's not winning
but i'd always say 
but if you look at the numbers just before the plague now the numbers are different we were going up up up we were beating them like a drum
but it is what it is and we're not happy about it and we're going to remember it
but remember i used to do that
but she looked at she watched the debate and she watched joe and she said 
but success was getting very very close to bringing us all together
but that was john's first crack
but think of that 200 we're talking about 200 plants
but this guy peters right
but we can solve those problems in a matter of literally minutes
but we could have a very big win
but we did more in 47 months than he did in 47 years
but we got them
but we have a good chance
but we were all set to go in there heard we were going in we informed them we're going in and they sent their police to do it and we never even had to go in
but we're keeping those small trucks and we're keeping our whole industry good
but when i made the deal with china i left the tariffs on 25% and some different amounts
but where's hunter who facilitated the sale of a michigan automotive company to a leading chinese military defense contractor
but you have maryland where they have a problem in terms of playing
by the way it's turning out to be john a super v
by the way the wall it's over 311 miles long right now doing very well
by the way we had tens of billions of dollars left over
can you imagine
can you imagine if i lost to him
can you imagine if on september 3rd they say 
certainly not anymore
china was flatlining for years and years and decades and it got into this world trade organization with all sorts of advantages
cnn
congressman jack bergman
could you imagine
couldn't believe it
crazy bernie wouldn't have nobody would add a clue on that one
darling it's so sad
darling it's so sad
darling who moved in next door
democrat republican
did they fight me on that one
do you believable it
do you think joe biden would do that
does anybody know that
does anybody want to have somebody from antifa as a member and as a resident of your suburb
does anyone know that china's military got yet another piece of american manufacturing mike and the biden family made a lot of money on it
does anyone know what i'm talking about
doing a great job
doing very well
don't be foolish
don't do it
don't do it
don't do that
don't do that to me michigan
don't forget he was in washington in his primetime which was never considered great and now it's no longer primetime
don't make the capital of israel jerusalem
don't move your embassy
don't say that i'll start to cry and that wouldn't be good for my image
donald trump has been declared
donald trump is against football
end it
europe's excess mortality rate is 24% higher than the rate in the united states
even though he's right he doesn't know
even though we made a trade deal with china
even though you're law enforcement that's a good job right
every president said they were going to do that and none of them did it for decades and decades they all said
everybody said it for very very many decades for decades many presidents
everything everything that biden was for was wrong
everything he did he was wrong on as said by gates you know
everything i can do we will do for you
favored nations
favored nations where we pay whatever the lowest is in the world we pay that number
fifty-four days from now we're going to win michigan and we're going to win four more years in the white house
first of all he didn't like tariffs and then all of a sudden he loves it
first time in a long time but now we're up in the polls
for the last four years they've tried everything to stop us and they are only getting more desperate by the day
for years and years they fought over the money to do it
for years you had a president who apologized for america
frankly if he had a little more support he would have won the last time
from grand rapids to saginaw from kalamazoo to mackinac and from flint to right here in freeland we stand on the shoulders of generations of michigan patriots who gave their blood sweat and tears for this beloved nation
from his perspective he made a mistake because he doesn't know what's going on
from terrorist hotspots around the world including syria somalia and yemen biden's pledged to have a 700% increase
gee i'm sorry
get out
getting along with foreign powers is not a bad thing
good job
good luck
good luck
good luck
great

great football great coach great team
great going john
great job

i don't like it because you got rid of the tariffs
i don't say this out of ego but i was nominated for the nobel peace prize
i don't think he likes me too much but that's okay
i don't think he's winning
i don't think so too much
i don't think there's any law enforcement officer that is against us
i don't want to do that
i gave away nothing
i gave it to our farmers

i think we've probably done the best job of any country certainly of any major country anywhere in the world on the pandemic
i thought it was a little less than that
i thought it was a much lower number
i thought you should put me in an office based on a much lower number
i told you he just said it was not as good as the deal i made
i want to get rid of it
i want to get rid of it
i want to just thank these guys because these were real warriors for all of us
i was doing very well
i was given man of the year award by somebody
i was honored in michigan
i was thinking about john more than myself because i know talent
i was very honored to receive the endorsement of the police officers association of michigan
i watched the democrat debates right
i watched them up there and he was so bad
i watched westchester in new york where they were doing things that should never have been done and it's not going to happen to our suburbs
i went to prime minister abe of japan
i wish trump were president
i wish you got to me a little bit sooner
i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal
i withdrew from the tpp my first week in office
i'd have to say i lost to the worst candidate ever put up
i'd only have about 10 or 15 people here
i'll call them back in a few days
i'll say it and they'll criticize for it you watch
i'll start to cry
i'll take it
i'll tell you
i'll tell you they lie
i'll tell you what i'll be so angry at you
i'll tell you why someday at another meeting why they call it that
i'm going to introduce you in a second john james
i'm joined tonight by some great warriors that have really helped me a lot in washington with the fake impeachment the impeachment hoax the russia russia russia hoax
i'm running for reelection to keep jobs in michigan
i'm sorry sir
i'm telling you sir one more speech
i'm telling you you watch next year better than last year
i'm the one that says open it up let's play football
i'm trying to convince him
i've already signed it
if biden wins china wins
if biden wins the mob wins
if biden wins the rioters anarchist arsonist and flag burners win
if biden's elected china will own america
if i get along that's good
if joe biden is elected far left lunatics won't just be running failed democrat city they'll be running the department of justice the department of homeland security and the united states supreme court and we can't let that happen
if we do get into war we win the war
if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands more americans would have died from the china plague
if we win america wins
if you do this we're going to stop doing business with your farmers and you're not going to be able to get any votes and you're going to lose the midwest and all of that
in a second term i will provide school choice to every parent in america
in cash
instead of being in a war i think agreeing to meet is okay right
is he giving away military information
is that right
is to appease domestic terrorists
it becomes automatically the capital of israel
it says 200
it was a lot of money
it was easy to talk about in the campaign 
it was election eve but by the time i got here it was late
it was in trouble and was exhausted from these ridiculous endless wars that lasts 19 and 20 years and you know those soldiers are starting to come home very big
it was john james
it was like an avalanche of companies leaving our country
it was success
it was wonderful
it wasn't a mistake
it won't be happening
it won't be happening
it would be
it'll be a tough race but you're going to win
it'll be finished very short
it's a tariff of 25% and it keeps other countries out of here and it expired and south korea didn't want to do it but they did it
it's all democrat governors
it's all done
it's all done
it's all going to be finished very quickly
it's all these people
it's always russia
it's an amazing thing
it's aoc plus three
it's bernie
it's going to be better than last year
it's going well
it's kamala the most liberal person in the us senate
it's like a habit that they press that particular trigger but that's a tough race
it's no good
it's not going to happen anymore
it's okay
it's okay not to go to war
it's peace and its recognition of israel and all of the things nobody thought it could be done
it's really hard
it's really nice to be with you
it's really okay
it's ridiculous
it's sad isn't it
it's so easy to be presidential
it's so sad
it's the place where general motors chrysler and kellogg revolutionized entire industries
it's too late
it's true
it's true
it's true
it's very simple
it's your radical left people
january 1st
joe biden devoted his career to offshoring michigan's jobs outsourcing we shouldn't be smiling about it but we've changed it around
joe biden has put forward the most extreme platform and it's not him
joe biden supported the disastrous trans-pacific partnership which would have been a death sentence for american auto jobs
joe biden surrendered your jobs to china and now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob and you're seeing that every night
joe biden's agenda is made in china
john and i were thinking about john
john james
john james get out and vote for john
john moolenaar
john you can run for a certain house seat right
just a terrible terrible situation took place
just all you have to do is take a look at all the ads they're running against me
just like crazy nancy pelosi your governor is a liberal hypocrite who lives by a different set of rules
just so you know china's paying us tens of billions of dollars a month
just take a look space force by itself that would be a major achievement and with us we did so many things so many things
just to finish in the middle east we killed the founder and leader of isis al-baghdadi
keep calm and carry on
ladies and gentlemen donald trump has been declared the winner
last week joe biden proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal portland district attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters criminals and violent extremists without charge
let's ask that question again but we brought back our manufacturing jobs
let's do it anyway
let's get out of here
let's get the hell out of here darling
let's go
let's go
let's go to monte-carlo this weekend
let's leave our suburbs
let's take a time out
lisa
lisa mcclain
long before i thought about running for president when i enjoyed my life i had the greatest life
long time it's been a long time since you had all these plants being built but we brought you a lot over the last three and a half years and we're going to bring you a lot more
look at what i've done for your suburbs
make the mic louder the mic louder
making matters worse he would open the flood gates in the middle of a pandemic
maybe way ahead
maybe you don't want to know about it
michigan gave us motown gave us motown gave us the mustang and the unrivaled might of the american midwest
michigan gave us motown right
michigan gop chair laura cox
michigan has already gained and regained more than half of the jobs that it lost and if your state was ever allowed to safely reopen by your governor who doesn't have a clue
michigan lost half of all manufacturing jobs after the trade deals that biden supported
michigan well you know this one right
michigan will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we'll allow sleepy joe to impose $4 trillion in tax hikes ban american energy confiscate your guns shut down the economy and tell your governor to open up your state
my agenda is made in the usa
my plan is to arrest them to lock them up
never speak well about our technology because you're giving away classified information
next year unless you have somebody that's going to quadruple your taxes raise your taxes raise up all of those regulations that we cut next year will be one of the greatest years of the history of our country
no city town or suburb will be safe
no he gave away so much
no he was just interviewed today
no i don't want to amend it
no i had a great life but i was honored
no i'm saying 
no it's a good thing
no it's a good thing
no it's a positive development for america and for the world
no it's not
no it's very nice
no major party has ever had a candidate that's so extreme in his views
no matter how you do it no matter how good the deal they'll say 
no more 20 year approvals or disapprovals
no more v
no no no
no no the usmca
no no we did it just the right way
no thank you
no that was a terrible thing and they're working very hard right now
no they've never heard it
no we did it the right way and we've done a job like nobody
no we left the tariffs on
no you got to leave the tariffs on
nobody does
nobody has anything like what we have
nobody knows him
not a single american who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator any time in our whole country
not going to happen
not going to happen
not only does joe biden want to eliminate your jobs he wants to eliminate your borders
not so bad
now i have to tell you that's sort of a big thing and the networks and most of the news didn't cover it
now i just want to let people know we have the greatest systems the greatest equipment and the greatest people anywhere in the world
now it's starting out to be a super v but to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to america not to china because if we win america wins and that's what it's about
now they have a tremendous disincentive to leave michigan fire all of our workers go to mexico or canada make the car or the product send it in here without tariffs
now they'll say 
now they've been building it for a number of years but you hadn't had a plan built in like 42 years
now this is what we're dealing with
now we are doing it again bigger and better than ever before
now we're building it again and it's being built fast
now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for michigan
oh but you agreed to meet
oh i see
oh it's a resident of antifa
oh it's too late sir
oh trump is going to destroy social security
oh well maybe it was a mistake
okay
okay
okay it's time now to be reasonable
on november 3rd michigan you better vote for me
on november 3rd your vote will save america
on tuesday i announced that i'm doing it
one more speech sir you're going to win michigan
one of the fake news broadcasters because this happened the other day we had a tremendous crowd like this
open up your state madam governor open up your state
or you can have a tough race against somebody that nobody ever heard of
our country is doing great
our doctors and they don't get any credit because they want to discredit us as much as possible because they want it to carry over to november 3rd but we've done a fantastic job
outsourcing michigan's factories throwing open your borders dragging us into endless foreign wars and surrendering our children's future to china and other far away lands
over the last three and a half years we've secured america's borders blocked the entry of foreign terrorist fixed our disastrous trade deals and we have fixed our trade deals good
paul junge
paul junge
paul thank you
people are dying we're dying
perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration
peters
play it back
please
please don't do it
please raise your head
please sir don't do it
president xi has nothing like it
price transparency
prime minister you have to start doing something
proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we will be taking back our country we'll be taking it back from people that don't love our country and that take back is almost complete
putin has nothing like it
raise your hands farmers
remember
remember he said 
remember it's the most important election we've ever had
remember north korea
remember that
remember they said last time
remember this we're the party of abraham lincoln
remember when they used to say 
republican-run cities are doing very well
right
right
right
right
right
right
ron i'm coming in one more time but that's it
ronna mcdaniel
russia russia
sand and blood
say 
schumer went 
secretary of defense secretary of everything
she dropped out but there's never been anything like this
she had 500 people
she meant this really me i view it differently
she said 
she started off her poll numbers at 15 14 12 12
she was the head of the whole state and she kept calling me back back
she's got interesting hair
she's like joe
shinzō shinzō you have to do me a favor
should have never let that happen
sir $12 billion the first year two years three years ago and then 16 billion a total of 28 billion
sir could you come in tomorrow for another speech
sir could you do it
sir i can do more in the senate than i can do in the house
sir one more speech you're going to win michigan
sir we can amend it and make it less crazy
sleepy joe biden voted for the iraq war
sleepy joe he's a beauty
so get your friends get your family get your neighbors and your coworkers and get out and vote
so he wants to belittle the vaccine because he doesn't want us to get credit plant who converted their factory to produce tens of thousands of ventilators after we invoked the defense production act and they've done a fantastic job
so he wants to lift it up by 700%
so important
so it should say 
so john i'm with you
so let's play big ten football right
so maybe we're better off being down a little bit
so now they're saying 
so went on and on
so when it came time to picking the head of the rnc as president you have a couple of things to say about it right
so you can be an absolute congressman or you can take a shot at this one
some of you are in that audience at one o'clock in the morning now election day
somebody said 
somebody said russia's coming up again
somebody said to me 
syria what do you get out of it

thank you very much
thanks laura
that deal is all done
that man is going to be a star
that sort of has a nice ring to it
that was in the republican primary
that was so easy
that was so easy
that woman is the most aggressive person i've ever met
that's a good thing
that's a lot
that's a nice plane
that's a terrible thing
that's a terrible thing
that's air force one
that's an honor
that's great
that's happening
that's it
that's not bad no i gave $28 billion to our farmers because they were targeted by china
that's not happening anymore
that's not happening anymore
that's okay
that's pretty good
that's really nice
that's right
that's right motown
that's the nicest
that's tough to beat john james
that's true
that's what i did
that's what i'm saying
that's what we did
that's when china became a big powerful economic power
that's where they're coming from
that's where they're coming from and there's nothing that sleepy joe biden can do about it
the biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy this great opportunity that we're having right now
the chicken tax
the chicken tax
the drug companies are not happy i will tell you
the elite has decided
the first lady actually came in and one time she watched it and she goes and she's a nice person
the left wants to get rid of me so they can come after you
the murder rate in democrat-run cities like chicago baltimore new york so many others is higher than in afghanistan yet biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide
the next day we're all set all lined up looking forward to it
the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
the people that control biden's plan
the same thing happened four years ago
the suburbs are the american dream and i will tell you i have protected your suburbs
the united states lost 500 auto and auto parts factories under the obama-biden disaster
the usmca includes powerful wage protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in michigan
then i got on the phone with 18 different companies
then i said 
then i went to sonny perdue secretary of agriculture a great guy i said sonny 
then she went back up to 12 and a half
then there was a big plunge right down to the bottom and then she dropped out
there were a little surprised to hear that
there were no teleprompters
there's never been a vision like this
there's no way he makes it
there's nobody like the us military
there's people back there that can't even get in
these fools
these fools
these people are sick
these people don't know what the hell they're doing and it's one of the reasons i got elected i can tell you that
these people practice disinformation like nobody has ever practiced it
these stupid people that have been running this operation for 30 40 years and they come out against me and all they did was stick us in these endless wars
they are good
they came and i heard about it
they didn't pay us 25 cents
they don't even know
they don't know who he is
they don't like telling you that
they don't love the country
they don't want to give you credit for that
they gave him a few chances
they gave it to them in a matter of weeks right
they got the killer they got the killer
they had a poll
they have a lot of power a lot of say
they just expanded
they love your state and they love our country
they needed a ventilator we had nothing
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 62% of the people are lying about their poll
they should have never ever let it happen
they started chanting 
they stopped it from going into china but they didn't stop it from coming out here and coming into the us in europe and the rest of the world 188 countries
they want to destroy your suburbs
they want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-american lies in our schools
they want to shut down auto production delay the vaccine
they wanted me to come out and scream 
they were going to be at war with north korea
they were rotting you
they were supposed to win michigan but they did such a lousy job that they had to come and get some votes
they were targeted
they were the old plants
they weren't even close
they will have had it
they will have had it
they're at it again
they're giving him hell
they're here someplace
they're liars
they're not elite
think of it
this guy
this guy is starting to do very well lying about his lifetime of cold hearted globalist betrayals
this is going to be a summer of love
this is going to be the biggest thing and nobody understands what it is
this is in their manifesto
this is not the crowd of a person who comes in second place
this is one guy right you must be a pretty rich guy
this is the guy i'm running against
this is the most important election in the history of our country
this is the state where henry ford invented the assembly line
this is the state where tough strong and determined workers made america into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world and we are making it greater and greater every single day
this is what it is
this time i hear you're even and maybe even ahead and we're going to win with john james
this was early on
this whack job that wrote the book he said 
thousands
through our historic relief programs we've saved more than 1
tim thank you
took a lot of guts
tough to beat
true
two months ago i also issued a major disaster declaration in response to the catastrophic flooding caused by the failure of the edenville dam
uh we don't know
under my administration we've achieved the most secure border in american history
unfortunately they let almost two weeks go by
very interesting
vote for john james
wait
wait i want to see that again
wait i want to see that again 200
was going to raise it to 50%
washington vultures like biden and others ripped apart entire towns all across your state

we did more in 47 months than sleepy joe biden did in 47 years
we didn't have teleprompters
we don't ever want to have war but if there is a war nobody's going to even come close to being able to beat us
we don't fight for nothing
we don't like his foreign policy
we don't want to be crazed lunatics
we end up with closed factories no job and no taxes
we ended it
we fought for nothing
we gave it to the us treasury right smack into the heart of the us treasury
we get along
we got $300 million to the great lakes restoration initiative and we have done a job on the soo locks
we got to fix this mess
we had 32000 people show up and the reason i went is that i heard that crooked hillary clinton bill clinton and barack hussein obama were traveling to michigan because they heard they had problems
we have a very much different party than we had four years ago
we have done so much on so many different fronts
we have enough of that

we passed the mission act we call it va choice and va accountability
we rebuilt the awesome power of the us military
we spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage joe biden inflicted over the last 47 years
we stupidly don't
we took in billions and billions and i said 
we took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of american troops qasem soleimani is dead
we want a governor john james that's going to let michigan play big ten football this year
we were coming together

you've been seeing a lot of the other schools want to open big ten at my suggestion
you've got to send car plants over here
your plane's just as nice as that

10 times
1024 how about this i was driving her crazy so she went out and hired a guy to check the blood
1024th and i've always said i have more indian blood in me than she has in her and i have none
16 years was going like this
332 to 95 think of it we have the strongest economy in history the lowest unemployment numbers ever we've rebuilt the most powerful military it was totally depleted when i took office and now it's rebuilt
52 years they tried to do that they didn't get it done so we're doing good
9th congressional district
9th i know it's not here but it's very close right
a big deal
a lot better
a man i know who i don't like a businessman very very very successful one of the most successful but i don't like him never liked him
a senator came to my office sir i'm six foot seven i'm great
a vote for any democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the american dream
above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one great nation as one america
ah yeah i'm sorry i ran out of time
al-qaeda makes you proud
all american citizens including millions and millions of legal immigrants who work hard to come into our country who study who wait on line sometimes for 10 years and who respect our laws and follow the rules they deserve a government that is loyal to them
all but two i've done hundreds of them
all i have to do is say 
all right
all windows all lights have to be off sir
always call me donald
america's respected again and because we are finally putting america first
and according to the polls i won every single debate republican and against hillary
and at a press conference just this week when asked whether she supported al-qaeda that's our enemy
and brad parscale is here the worlds tallest campaign manager in the history of the world
and by the way north carolina has had its best economic year in the history of your state
and by the way really successful
and by the way thousands and thousands of people outside and people that couldn't get in thousand
and everybody will get a free rolls-royce every family gets a free rolls-royce every family
and guys like biden say 
and he goes 
and he just told me our poll numbers are through the roof he just told me that so i'll take that
and he really admires socialism i don't think that works too well in north carolina
and he said 
and he said to me 
and he was there eight years 
and he will indeed defend your values your family and he will always defend our second amendment unlike the opponents
and her brother's here i have to tell you he went to this college
and i saw him about two months ago and he came up to me i said 
and i wouldn't have said it because i wasn't even sure we could do it
and i'll tell you what some of them said 
and i'll watch i'll go back to the 
and if you don't support me you're going to be so goddamn poor you're not going to believe it
and in north carolina and we're far from finished it's a big problem it declined 8% last year
and it is funny with the name mr
and it's so angry even yesterday they went on the stage
and just so you know we have made america great again
and likewise women 74 years
and maybe we didn't get along
and mike said he never did a good job i'm so shocked to see him running
and my previous general said 
and north carolina gop chair michael whatley incredible ncaa wrestling champion great guy
and now i want to be two for two two for two
and obviously and importantly omar has a history of launching vicious antisemitic screens
and on top of that it's a good choice because we've done the right thing
and sadly china who i have a very good relationship with president xi i really like him
and thanks to our pledge to america's workers private sector partners will provide apprenticeships and job training to 9 million americans isn't that nice
and that actually when he had the scandal that became can you believe it
and that was for a reason
and the anger they were trying to be nice but it's hard
and the media said 
and the reason we have to not only to do new things which we will and you know statutorily and we had all sorts of artificial witch hunts over our head
and the worst treated of all children but it's women women the democrats want to do nothing about it
and then he goes back home and african americans literally were so angry at him for the lousy job and he's supposed to be like a hot young star if that's a hot young star i guess i just don't no star anymore
and then he said 
and then i thought to myself think of it we've spent almost $8 trillion in the middle east and we got to turn off the lights of an airplane to land how bad is that
and then it was state after state it was florida it was south carolina we love south carolina
and then on top of it a couple of months ago i just approved the golan heights for israel
and then the indians got together and they said 
and then they say women don't like trump i think they do
and then we had a surprise but not a surprise to us because we're bringing back the auto industry
and then we won the great state of wisconsin
and then you have a young guy buttigieg buttigieg
and they did in the last election and we're doing a lot better
and they did their job didn't they
and they want to try and impeach it's a disgrace
and tlaib also used the f word to describe the presidency and your president
and to mike pence you've done a great job
and tonight i have a suggestion for the hate filled extremists who are constantly trying to tear our country down
and we have all night we're going to have a lot of fun tonight and i have nothing to do nothing nothing
and we have good relationships with them and many others except now we're no longer the suckers
and we have secured soon to be three years record funding for our military
and we listen to her talking about drinking water from toilets which was a lie which was a lie
and we live by the words of our national motto 
and we won by a lot i was telling mike i was telling my son eric trump and lara's here y the way who was born in north carolina
and we're landing and i still haven't seen a light
and we're not just going to hit them from our temporary base in syria sir we're going to hit him from iraq we're going to hit them from places that they never knew existed sir
and you know a friend of mine said maybe you wouldn't have done as well
and you know to be honest it's not like they came and we want to take care of people
and you know you can go all over the world in some cases it was morning
anguilla anguilla you got to pay anguilla
anguilla you got to pay your bills you're way behind
as we're landing i said 
awesome because that's what it's about
because then they go home to mom and dad
because they want a strong border
because together we will make america wealthy again of course we did just hit the highest price in the history of the market
because we freed up our country we freed up our economy especially with regulation cuts but also with those big beautiful tax cuts
better healthcare
but again i have to tell you this vote was so big
but bernie's desperate now i watch him up there it's a sad situation
but can you imagine if i said 
but could you imagine what it could have been if we didn't have the witch hunt
but everybody that knows him knows that
but everything that we built low taxes strong military taking care of our vets all of the things we've done can be decimated very quickly if the wrong person gets in especially now
but i can say nobody in their first two and a half years has done anywhere close to what we not being what we not me what we've all done
but i think they're all sad when you get right down to it
but i want to tell you something the democrats are being violent so vicious moving so far left it's out of control
but ice they go into a nest they call it a nest a nest of these killers
but it says 20 here's where we go we start at 16 we go to 20 we go to 24 did you see it
but it's not like he has a choice he has no choice
but it's true we have the enthusiasm folks
but look at this look at those beautiful hats
but no harris hit him with the pretty easy question on busing
but the radical democrats are trying to destroy all of our country's tremendous achievement and our country's tremendous success
but these guys we have the greatest pilots in the world we have the greatest military in the world we have the greatest equipment in the world
but these kids and these people come from rough places
but these left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force of evil
but they always attract people that really can't defend themselves very well
but they always attract people that really can't defend themselves very well
but they said it was going to take a long time
but they're like from a movie there is nobody in hollywood plays a role like this
but we are we're one movement we're one people one family and one glorious nation under god
but we fight to short of just keep going we don't fight to win i fight to win
but we have to give a couple because that's the great thing about live television
but we're building a lot of wall and we hope if we can win that final one it's so important it's going before the supreme court we'll have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year
but we're going to have the country all set for your child okay
but you know what if we don't win in 2020 everything that we've done seriously though everything that we've done your 401's are going to crash the whole thing it's going to come down like a stack of cards
but you think it's easy don't you folks you think this is easy
buut-ih-jij you say buut and then add ih-jij buttigieg
by that time just so you know by that time our country will be so well seated it will be so strong like never ever in our history
by the way i keep hearing how much enthusiasm is in the radical left
can you believe that how important it is and yet that was the second biggest story and what a shame when that's the second biggest story
can you imagine
can you imagine
can you imagine
can you imagine if keep america great didn't work
can you imagine if we didn't have to go through that hoax
check out her scores by the way with her green new deal the green new deal
congratulations husband
cortez said that illegal immigrants are more american than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be can you believe that
could you imagine if we didn't have the time wasted the time and everything
dan
democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion intolerance and division
democrats have never been farther outside of the mainstream
didn't mean to embarrass your mom
do you remember a certain hand on that beautiful board and they said 
doesn't work too well in our country
don't disappoint me that should be good for at least 10 points right
don't put that i said free rolls royce
donald trump has won the great state of north carolina
donald trump is exaggerating
donald trump is not liked in europe nearly as much as president obama
every day we make good on the motto promises made promises kept
every nation has the right to establish and enforce immigration rules in it's national interest it's very simple isn't it
except for these six seven ladies up here they always talk
first time in many many decades that a republican won
first time it was a big problem
folks sorry you got to pay your fair share
for instance we're in this incredible state north carolina that you have your best economy that you've ever had
for political reasons and you know what it's going to cost them a lot of points in the election i think probably cost them the election itself
forget the country for a second you have the best economy you've ever had you have your best unemployment numbers you had the most people working than at any time in the history of your state you have your best black unemployment numbers best hispanic unemployment numbers best women unemployment numbers best asian unemployment numbers
frankly the destruction of our country that's what's going to happen
frankly they're as tough or tougher than china just smaller in numbers
general how long can it take
generals i've been told it's going take a year two years to get a 100%
give up maga
good luck
great job
great ladies you're great
great vice president
great victory by the way that was a great primary and a great victory

greg is a winner
greg murphy
greg stanton
he calls me mr
he checked her blood and found out that many many many many many many years ago there could have been somebody and he could have been indian
he choked
he goes home now to mommy and he gets reprimanded and that's the end
he knows that they're not getting a rolls-royce
he never liked me by the way
he ran out of time

he said it
he wanted to stay back

he's actually not even a democrat isn't he an independent
he's desperate now he's desperate
he's going to stay
he's not doing too well but that's okay
he's not mentally prepared that's his problem
he's not prepared
he's the tallest in the history but most importantly he's the best
her colleague representative rashida tlaib agreed with omar's characterization of 9/11 and said that members of congress who support israel forgot what country they represent
hey bernie let me save you a lot of time and effort bernie you missed your time
hey don how you doing
hey if they don't like it let them leave
hey maybe that is a good idea let's think about it
his city is doing so badly
how about california they just approved a $100 million
how are you doing
how dare he used that name
how do you give up maga
how many have you been to just out of curiosity
how stupid is that
how was he as the mayor
human trafficking it's a terrible terrible thing and we got to solve it
human trafficking the first time i heard as a politician human trafficking nobody talks about it it sounded almost like an ancient crime many many years ago hundreds of years thousands of years ago human trafficking it's the worst now throughout the world because of the internet it's the worst it's ever been
i brought it up too soon so i don't talk about it anymore but if she should be the candidate which i tend to doubt but if she should be we'll bring it up again and i think it will be very successful
i do want to come but i really want you to win today if you don't mind
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know see him dealing with vladimir putin
i don't know that we would've done any better to be honest with you
i don't see
i don't see any light pilot
i don't see him dealing and nobody has been tougher with russia than donald trump
i don't see him dealing with president xi of china
i don't see him meeting successfully with kim jong-un
i don't see it major how about lifting up let's go around
i don't think so
i don't think they have enthusiasm
i don't think they're human beings
i don't think we'll lose in north carolina
i don't want any part but that's when you saw the people say what the hell is going on
i earned it
i fight to win
i go in and make a speech i say let me speak to anguilla
i got to hand it to him he's up there ranting and raving and going like a lunatic
i had the greatest phrase probably in the history of politics in this country
i have middle of the road i have poor i have everybody
i have none but it's more than she has 1024
i have poor guys middle of the road and rich guys doesn't matter
i have to thank many of the democrats
i joke i said 
i just heard that the united states house of representative has overwhelmingly voted to kill the most ridiculous project i've ever been involved in the resolution
i just know this it can disappear very very quickly
i kept coming in and coming out and every time i left they said 
i know tonight's not so good we got a hundred degrees out but you still have thousands of people out there
i know why because the pressure on them was enormous not to do it
i mean bats even they're whacking people with bats
i mean that was amazing
i mean think of that one and she looks down with contempt on the hardworking american saying that ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country
i met with generals general believe it or not one general his name is raisin
i never have liked you and you never have liked me but you're going to support me because you're a rich guy
i never saw that guy in my life which is true
i ran out of time
i really do
i respect it
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said did raisin kane and a couple of other generals that were there these guys are central casting like from a movie except better
i said raisin kane you're my kind of general
i said to him great people 28 nations including the us i said to him 
i said to our first lady the other day i was watching bernie and he's screaming his hair's all crazy i'm going to do this i'm going to do that no more college loans no more cost for anything
i said to raisin kane and the other generals 
i saw one of these so-called comedians the other day and he's a pretty respected comedian he said he's not leaving
i say 
i tell them all the time you have no idea how much the american people the american public you have no idea how much they love you and respect you law enforcement
i think it was maybe you know there are those that say one of the most extraordinary and exciting evenings in the history of television and the history of anything
i think that's like a poll that's like a poll because when biden goes out i see sleepy joe and he says 
i think that's worse but we'll save it for whoever's going to be the nominee and right now sleepy joe's not looking too good pocahontas
i think we've done more in two and a half years than any president ever< first two and a half years
i want to introduce the next member of congress from north carolina's third congressional district just won a great race dr
i want to thank republican leadership for what they've done for all of us by stopping that hoax the russian hoax i call it because america is winning again
i want to thank those democrats because many of them voted for us
i was on so many times i don't even read this thing and it says trump 2014 2018
i was right
i wasn't prepared for that question
i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided disgusting iran nuclear deal and iran is a different country today than it was
i won't say it because it's a harrell it's a terrible word
i'll give you just a couple i've had pages and pages but we don't want to bore you
i'm an air force one and they notified me 
i'm doing good you're doing good
i'm going to show you something someday soon i'm going to show you something
i'm gone
i'm saying you got to pay
i'm six foot seven so i can give you great advice
i'm sorry don't put it
i'm sure he had a lot of fun doing that
i'm telling you he's not leaving he'll never live
i've always said 2016 was the most important election maybe in the history of our country a lot of people felt that
i've had people back there that don't like me and somebody said very nicely that he's actually made certain promises and he's actually kept more promises than he's made
i've proudly signed for bi-partisan human trafficking laws securing $400 million dollars to support victims of human trafficking
if i lost every one of those votes we still win by a lot and they wouldn't announce it
if i see you here i'm going to be very angry
if i would have said that nobody would have believed it
if i would've said that the fake news would have said he's exaggerating
if they don't love it tell them to leave it
if you like your plan you can keep your plan if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor 28 times a total lie
in fact i would go a step further he cannot stand me
in fact i'm disliked but actually they respect us that's more important
in god we trust
in other words she slandered the brave americans who were trying to keep peace in somalia
in the recent democratic debate every single candidate everyone biden was a little bit slower with the hand it didn't work so well
is she related in any way to elvis
is that possible
isis does not like me too much but i came here and it was a mess
it got taken from you four years ago bernie
it was a mess
it was just record setting and here's the point we have to do it again
it was pennsylvania
it was unlucky
it would be so great
it's a beautiful thing it's a beautiful thing what's happening with prisoners they get out and they can actually get a job and that's what's happening and we're very proud of them
it's a big thing prisoners they've gotten out of jail and they never had an economy like this
it's a disgrace
it's a great thing is that your husband
it's about you
it's about your family it's about your future and the fate of your beautiful loving country and that's what it is
it's been phenomenal we have 180 million people right now really happy on private plans and you know what they're going to be taken away
it's called normal political back and forth
it's common sense it's so simple and the voters understand that
it's getting better better better
it's going to be a long time before we take out the caliphate
it's going to be much greater every year it's getting better and better
it's going to be much greater every year it's getting better and better
it's hard for them to do that
it's interesting with women so women want to have a strong military protection they want to have strong borders they want to have strong law enforcement they want to have great education they want to have low taxes for their family not high taxes
it's like pulling teeth
it's like when i called pocahontas pocahontas i should've waited six months because she then went out and got that test
it's not in our history but we're going to be there very soon
it's okay
it's one america
it's out of control
it's richard
it's so simple everybody knows it
it's true
it's true
it's true i'm not doing my job
it's wonderful to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of hardworking north carolina patriots and thank you for your support
just lastly democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities which release violent criminal aliens onto our streets
kane
keep america great
keep america great that's right
lara do you love this state
last year for the first time in over 50 years drug prices went down

let them leave
let's do it again
let's do it again
let's get out of here
let's go to dinner
let's think about it
let's win this election nationwide
lieutenant governor dan forest lieutenant governor

many many polls
many many presidents have said 
maybe we would have had too much time on our hands
mike is one of the nicest human beings you'll ever meet
mike pence was the governor of that state
more than 130 democrats in congress have signed up for bernie sanders total government takeover of healthcare isn't that nice
most of it comes through in this country our southern border where we don't have the wall
most of those indicted were in our country illegally 19 to be exact 19 of 22
mr
mr
mr
mr
my administration is defending your sacred right to choose the doctor and the plan that you want and we are offering plans up to 60% cheaper than obamacare and a lot of people are starting to figure that out
my administration proudly recognized the true capitol of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
my generals did a great job i flew there i flew to iraq remember
never been such excitement

no trump is stopping it
no we don't need any more time
nobody talks about it it's one of the great successes
nobody's ever heard anything like that nobody's ever seen anything like it
nobody's ever seen anything like it
north carolina i'm going to do a great job
north carolina treasurer dale folwell
not a good thing to say
not doing too well
not to us it wasn't but a lot of people said it was the greatest election we've ever had
nothing you're not going to pay for anything
november 8th that was a big deal
now i only hope they don't change because we're talking too soon we got a year and a half left
now i see them they're great
now the media will say that's a prop they say no baby is so beautiful
now they don't want it you know why they don't want it
now they're coming out and we have programs but most of all we have this great economy where people are hiring prisoners and you have to see the reviews they're getting they getting phenomenal reviews
now you're 
number one you wouldn't be here you wouldn't be here
obama president obama
obama would go in make a speech leave
of course because i'm making them pay their bills
oh good rich hey richard loosen up
oh isn't that lovely
oh sir that was so controversial sir
okay
okay
okay thank you donald thank you very much
okay you better stay back
omar blamed the united states for the crisis in venezuela
omar laughed that americans speak of al-qaeda in a menacing tone and remark that you don't say america with this intensity
omar minimized the september 11th attacks on our homeland saying some people did something
one hell of a night
one of the most beautiful venues i've ever seen but i don't want any part of it
or president bush or anybody
otherwise we'll just wait til we win back the house win the senate win the presidency and we'll vote
our country has added more than 180000 people to the workforce and think of that through what we've done on a federal basis
our economic policy can be summed up in three very beautiful and simple words jobs jobs jobs
our new phrase for the 2020 campaign is 
own impeachment
patients with preexisting conditions are protected by republicans much more so than protected by democrats who will never be able to pull it off
pocahontas is gaining a little bit because we probably use the pocahontas a little bit too early but that's okay
polls are just as fake as the news itself but women filled 60% and i'm sorry to tell you this men they're going to sue me for discrimination now
preexisting conditions and you know the job we've done on healthcare it's not talked about but we're also doing something
president
president everybody calls me mr
president how are you sir
president i have friends really good friends and they've always called me don donald d they call me anything and you lose all your friends when you're president because they're all afraid to talk to you does that make sense
president i'd like to congratulate you on the incredible economy that you've created
president it's true it's a funny thing
president you're right i'm supporting you i think you're doing a great job
raisin like you mean a little raisin
really great people
remember deplorables right
remember i want to pull them out we're down to 1% and everyone went crazy explain that one
remember they wouldn't announce the numbers in pennsylvania so there was 1% of the vote remaining
representative alexandria ocasio-cortez
representative ayanna pressle
representative ilhan omar of a really great state i almost won the first time in decades and decades minnesota
republicans believe that every life is a sacred gift of god
republicans know that america is the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of our world
rich guys call up 
richard call me donald like you always did call me donald
right
right
right
right
sanctuary city wonderful sanctuary city
senator i'm one for one but it happened to be the president
seriously
she described contemporary america that's you that's me that's all of us as garbage garbage a garbage
she didn't want to give an answer to that question
she pleaded for compassion for isis recruits attempting to join the terrorist organization
she refused to answer
she smeared us service members involved in black hawk down
she spent a fortune here and i kept coming in and coming out
she thinks that people with the same skin color all need to think the same or military
she was describing the president of the united states and the presidency with the big fat vicious the way she said it vicious f-word
she was looking for compassion
she's conducted outrageous attacks against men and women of law enforcement she compared american border agents managing a humanitarian crisis that i always said was a humanitarian crisis and they said it was manufactured
sir
sir it's right there sir
sir my name is raisin
sir one month
sir we're 45 minutes out sir
so cortez also she said essentially nazis are running concentration camps and when mike pence went down just a few days ago with members of congress and the media and you looked at those so-called horrible concentration camps they said 
so go out get greg elected
so here's one we will make america strong again
so hispanic american the best unemployment numbers in our history asian americans the best unemployment numbers in our history
so i don't know i can't say this is more important what we did was a miracle
so i just want to thank everybody
so i really think it's at least equal it's equal maybe it's a little less who the hell knows
so i will not say that this guy said if we didn't have the bullshit that's all
so i'm sorry women i let you down
so if you don't want democrats to raid your healthcare to steal away your money to bankrupt your country then you have a choice you must vote republican
so in a certain way let's say this is of equal importance by that time we'll have values instilled we'll have free enterprise instilled people are working now
so last year i went and said 
so now we have that behind us and i have to say this and i'll say it just once what happened to me with this witch hunt should never be allowed to happen to another president of the united states
so pretty soon and i hate to say i don't want to ruin the rhetorical skill but that is sort of like getting a little obsolete we will make our nation wealthy again
so representative omar blames the united states for the terrorist attacks on our country saying that terrorism is a reaction to our involvement in other people's affairs
so respected
so that's omar
so these congresswomen their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left but that's okay because we're going to win this election like nobody's ever seen before
so these congresswomen their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left but that's so they are very evil
so we did through our friend dan scavino we did a time magazine cover
so we land in this big beautiful air force one and i'm saying 
so we're taking care of trade
so we're thrilled tonight to be joined by several north carolina republican leaders
so you know greg would be great on jobs all the things you want tough on crime strong on borders pushing the wall he'll be pushing it like nobody
so you must never forget the 2020 election is all about one thing you
some people did something
sometimes i hate to say it dictators and they all start off by saying 
sorry men
sorry mom
sorry mommy
suppression
take a look around their party is afflicted with an ideological sickness that protects foreign borders but refuses to protect our own borders
takes too much time
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you brad
thank you dan
thank you dan
thank you darling that's really nice
thank you for that very big victory we had three years ago
thank you mike
thank you to greenville north carolina i want to thank you
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you very much thom
that can happen
that choice for every american has never been more clear
that didn't work out too well we had 14 seasons think of that the apprentice
that doesn't mean the other countries are thrilled with me there was a recent poll germany likes obama better than trump
that had to be a set up
that is a beautiful baby
that is not as star
that sounds worse
that was a shocker remember that
that was a slaughter but many of those people that voted for us this afternoon in somewhat of a sneak attack a real sneak attack many of those people that voted for us were democrats and i want to thank them because they did the right thing for our country
that was some day they all said 
that was when you started to see the folks at a certain other convention beautiful looking place
that's a great thing thank you
that's a lot because it was just going up like a rocket
that's a lot of signs
that's for sure
that's for sure
that's like from an advertisement perfect
that's not a good answer
that's not a star
that's not nice even for me
that's not somebody that loves our country
that's omar
that's our enemy
that's our first row
that's republican
that's the end of trump
that's the first i've heard of it that's the first most of you have heard of it and then they pass legislation in various states saying that's okay
that's the last thing we want to do in that part of the world
that's the only difference
that's true
that's what she say
that's why i say 
that's why i'm starting early can you believe it
that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion of babies
the contribution and now it's like a rocket ship $100 billion
the danger that they have is incredible
the democrat agenda is anti worker anti jobs anti citizen anti-family and anti common sense
the democrat in the race is an ultra liberal named dan mccready he wants to take away your guns he wants to raise you taxes he doesn't care about borders he likes open borders
the democratic record on healthcare is one of deception and destruction the last administration said a lie
the democrats all know it because five years ago before i was here they all wanted it
the difference is the last election i was a successful businessman running for president i said i was going to do things
the fact is we have the strongest stock market in our history so i think i'll have to change it
the golan heights another thing
the greatest anywhere in the world by far
the guy never passed the bill he did nothing
the leading voices of the democrat party are left wing extremists who reject everything our nation stands for
the other side is going to go the opposite
the republican agenda is pro-worker pro-jobs pro-family pro-growth and 100% pro-american
the republican party is the party for all americans and american values
the second biggest story
the unemployment rate among african americans is the lowest in the history of our country
the vote was a totally lopsided 332 to 95 to 1
the way they speak so badly of our country
the worlds tallest manager but he's the best manager
then it says 28 32 36 40 42
then they never did
then we got this tremendous number of women
there has never been a movement like this you don't hear it that often
there's a lot of red up there
there's never been anything like it never been such excitement
these are great people
these are great people and they don't get the credit that they deserve but you know what
these are human beings
these are sick people
these are some of the greatest ladies i see them in ohio and florida
they always go back most of the time
they always show up with a mask and they're covered
they always show up with a mask and they're covered because then they go home to mom and dad
they are a very serious problem that we take care of but they always seem to come along somewhere
they are fine and you'll lose to them it's different
they call it earned media
they can come back when they want but you know they don't love our country i think in some cases they hate our country
they can't breathe because people have such respect for the office of the presidency they have respect for the office of the president
they can't cut it
they did a poll on one of these networks and they would say 
they didn't do their job
they do a good job
they don't say it was manufactured and we're stopping it and i want to thank mexico
they don't want crime coming they don't want to lose their jobs
they don't want mom and dad to know where they were
they don't want mom and dad to know where they were
they figured you know what we'll do we'll get arnold schwarzenegger to take my place that didn't work out too well
they going to be in a very dim
they had 115 people show up 115 people
they have a new one who knocked the hell out of biden during the debate
they have air conditioning they have water
they have respect for our country again our country is respected again
they have so many messages he's really stupid then next week donald trump has a sinister plot to take over the world he can't be too stupid because they actually think it's working
they have to come in based on merit and we're putting in bills and let's see what happens
they have water they have air conditioning they have things that they've never seen
they just approved $100 million to take care of the needs of illegal immigrants and then you look on the sidewalks of los angeles the sidewalks of san francisco nancy pelosi's district nobody's ever seen anything like it in the history of our country what's happening there
they like the fact that their salaries are going up their wages are going up they understand it better
they never have anything good to say
they raised their hand in favor of giving free government healthcare
they raised their hand in giving a lot of other things that i don't think you're going to be happy with illegal aliens will be very nicely covered
they said 
they say he was really successful he wasn't successful he's really smart or he's really stupid but he's trying to take over the world
they understand the border better than anybody and they don't want criminals coming in
they want it because they understand the border better than anybody
they want that strong border
they want that wall and they really do
they want that wall that's being built right now
they want to demolish our constitution weaken our military eliminate the values that built this magnificent country
they want to have all the things that we talk about why wouldn't they want trump more than anybody else
they were really people out there think i'm not leaving can you believe it
they won't admit that
they work hard
they wouldn't announce it
they'll get me that they'll say majors aren't 30 maybe he's 35 whatever he is
they're attacking this group
they're attacking this group
they're fighting each other
they're fine they're fine
they're going crazy folks they're going crazy
they're going to go crazy
they're going to take your guns away
they're hitting people over the head with sticks and i mean sticks
they're just fighting with each other
they're not attack north carolina
they're not attack north carolina
they're not going through our points they're not going through areas where we have security where we have guards where we have gates where we have all sorts of equipment no they ride through the desert and they make a left where you don't have the wall
they're not intimidated
they're really into destroying our second amendment
they're saying 
they're saying how to say his name buut-ih-jij
they're stronger bigger tougher meaner and actually better looking in a certain way
they're tough they're smart and you know what they're great patriots they love our country
they're very brave
they're very brave
they've been so helpful to me and they're doing an incredible job
they've been trying to get that for 44 years joyce had been trying to get practically from the beginning joyce's so simple and yet they never got it nobody got it through
they've gone so far left nobody wants to even think about it
they've got 21000 soldiers now stopping people from coming into our country
they've tightened up they've choked
think of it 6 million jobs since election day think of it
think of it they fight all over though a lot of those people are coming back home folks they're coming back home a lot
think of that and you have your lowest unemployment rate
this guy's like out of a movie
this is a baby that's born
this is a baby that's born this isn't late term
this is a guy who used to 
this is not a good deal for the united states
this is the proud banner the republican party will carry into the republican national convention next summer in the great city of charlotte north carolina
this is the strongest movement in the history of our country
this man is from the great state of ohio congressman jim jordan

you don't like me and i don't like you
you don't speak that way about america
you getting ready
you go to asia you go to europe you go all over
you have a lot of good things but let's not talk too much about north carolina
you have the best numbers in the history of our country in your state so i don't know and we won by a lot
you have to look at some of their recent comments which are never talked about
you know in a very short period of time if the democrats would give us a few votes we could solve the immigration problem and it would be so great
you know it's called suppression polls
you know they're attacking a single man standing there with a camera who never got hit and never hit back before in his life that
you know this sport is getting awfully red
you know we got a world balance but european union is terrible to us on trade terrible

a few members of the ufc community
a friend of mine for a long time
a guy like biden would totally eradicate nevada's economy
a man who's a bad guy bad guy shot somebody right in the middle of the street who they say was a very fine young man
a shutdown we'll destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of american
a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs a limitless future for all americans
a wall
a wall and a wheel
a wall and a wheel
a wall won't work
abdelaziz
absolutely yes i would
al-baghdadi we eliminated the number one terrorist in the world
all around our country our communities are protected by hispanic american heroes in law enforcement and they deserve unwavering gratitude
all good
alonzo cruz
also a las vegas legend rick harrison
although china i must tell you got a real problem with china
america wasn't great
america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
america's the most exceptional nation on earth
and 51 days from now we're going to win nevada and we're going to win four more years in the white house
and a friend of mine and thank you michael
and a great gentleman who owns this building said 
and a person with tremendous spirit and personality to put it mildly
and after we win four more years we'll ask for maybe another four or so
and all i know is just like we have outside we had lines
and alonzo doesn't mess with henry he learned that a long time ago
and also ali abdelaziz right
and as you know in portland the other day we had to send in the us marshalls
and bernie goes 
and biden's anti-police crusade must stop
and by the way getting along with them is good
and by the way he wasn't smart 25 years ago
and by the way the united states supreme court
and charter schools have been great
and colby is a very fit guy and fantastic
and dana brought along a few of his friends and these are not people you want to pick a fight with
and he also loves his fighters
and he said 
and he was unable to explain do you remember
and he wears the hat and he's going like this because this was a big story
and he will have nothing to do with it
and he's already said if the doctor suggested he would shut down the country again
and he's looking at doing all of this stuff
and henry please stand please
and his brother alonzo is here
and i called for a drug test because you know what
and i don't mean for a little
and i don't want it myself but i want it for the admirals and the generals and mike pence
and i just want to thank all of them including the national troopers association and coalition just came in
and i want to thank for that steve grammar who's with us tonight
and i want to thank not only law enforcement but a big part of law enforcement the border patrol and the ice agents they're incredible
and i'm deeply honored to have gotten all of those endorsements
and i'm running for your state
and i've accomplished more in 47 months than joe biden did in 47 years
and if elected his radical supporters won't just be causing mayhem on the streets
and in the ad they have me saying horrible things in front of other people
and it was 10 people against one
and jim marchant
and joe biden was against it
and many other countries are coming in the united arab emirates and bahrain have both agreed to normalize relations with israel
and now we're doing it again
and of course they also have a place called portland and we will put that fire out
and our destiny is blessed by god
and she's by the way just so you know what you're going to get
and so they sent them in
and tell you governor to open up your state by the way
and that's actually when we learn the most
and that's no way to attain the office
and that's what we're doing at a record clip
and the first time i saw colby covington he walks into the ring
and then biden said 
and then he goes back into the basement for four days
and then he walks in wearing the hat 
and there's a reason for it
and they all have democrat governors
and they are new york's finest but they're not allowed to do their job
and they don't want criminals coming across
and they said 
and they understood that
and they were saying it's wicked sinful
and they're great
and we also believe that if you murder a police officer you should receive the death penalty and that's something that's very important fine people
and we did it again and again and again and it became the ufc and he sold it and has a big chunk of it but he got $4 billion when he sold it
and we did the right thing
and we go back and we take a look
and we have the strongest southern border now that we've ever had
and we loved them and nobody like our dana
and we want to keep this state strong
and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
and we will ban sanctuary cities
and we will have a very different country
and we will very easily defeat the china virus
and we'll be watching the ballots very closely also by the way
and we'll soon be there again
and we're already making that turn
and we're building many auto plants you know that some here but we're building many auto plants in michigan many auto plants in michigan
and we're showing a poll that just came out that we're two points up in michigan
and we're talking over a 50 year period
and we're with you all the way dan
and what happened
and you always go back to the first statement
and you could send your ballot and then you have to check that your ballot's counted because they might not count your ballot in this state
and you don't change
and you feel good about that fight
and you know we had it done
and you know what
and you know what
and you know what
and you know when you look at the suicide rates when you look at all of the suicide all of the domestic violence the drugs all of the problems we can't have it
and you think 
another great champion henry cejudo one of the best in the world
another great great champion
art
as long as it has trump on in someplace he doesn't care
as we begin tonight our thoughts are with the two sheriff's deputies in los angeles who were fighting for their lives when a vicious criminal walked up to their vehicle and shot them at point blank range
at biden's convention they decried america wicked
at his convention he never even mentioned the words 
at no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties two visions two philosophies two agendas for the future
at that time nobody else did
auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe the trans-pacific partnership
barack hussein obama he got it
because all of these countries friend and foe they ripoff the united states
because it was like he just became president and they said 
because people cannot stand nancy pelosi
because they'll last for 25 30 40 years
because this is beyond socialism
because under those beautiful suits there are a lot of muscles a lot of power a lot of genius for fighting and for other things but a lot of genius under those suits
bernie is crazy
bernie sanders crazy bernie
better policy but they don't have that vicious streak
biden got it
biden pledges to oppose school choice and he stated that if elected charter schools are gone
biden voted for the iraq war
biden will always do whatever the radical left demands
biden's agenda is made in china my agenda is made in the usa
but a wall will never be obsolete and a wheel will never be obsolete
but biden is too weak to be president and he's not a smart person
but biden's too scared to stand up to the crazy socialists and never will
but during violent demonstrations in las vegas a 29-year-old police officer you know this very well was deliberately shot in the head leaving the young brave officer paralyzed yet sleepy joe biden and his supporters continue their dangerous war on the police
but every once in a while i'll ask him 
but he didn't look quite the same
but he is a talented guy with tremendous energy and tremendous brain power rick grenell
but he really is he's an incredible guy
but hopefully as we round that final turn on the pandemic we're setting records with the stock market
but how about chicago
but i hate to say it i'm what you need
but i think that's a very strong statement
but i want to introduce dana white
but i was going to say when he put that ad up we told him to take it down
but i'd like to introduce colby covington
but i'll tell you what if he ever got in you would have a market crash the likes of which this country has never seen before
but i'm running for reelection to bring back the tremendous prosperity that we enjoyed before the plague came in and it's happening very fast
but if biden ever did win he would surrender your country to the mob
but instead of giving money they should give money to the families of the crime victims and the fallen officers
but it's true
but later on he said 
but our hispanic population knows our southern border better than anybody else
but the fact is that we got a lot of bernie votes four years ago because bernie's right about one thing trade
but the fake news media didn't cover it so that's it
but these are great people that they have so many people at the ufc and they've been big fans of us
but this was the same day that we had our conservative reporter beat to hell by that wise guy who's now in big trouble for doing what he did
but we know the truth
but we need law and order
but we want to ensure the future of america not the future of china and other countries because if we win america wins and it's all about america first
but we're looking to save and we're going to save america
but when they do ask for help and when they do we go in
but you guys we have your back 100%
but you see i deal with all of these people and they don't have the kind of mental problem that sleepy joe has
by the way how bad is she
by the way our stock market is setting records i hate to say in the middle a pandemic
call us hispanic
call us latino
call us whatever the hell you want
can i tell this story just quickly do you mind
can you believe that
chicago endorsed me oklahoma endorsed me texas endorsed me florida endorsed me
chicago fraternal order of police
china should have never let that happen
come to chinatown
comma
conservative reporter not a fighter
could you move that a little bit closer
could you possibly do it during the football game
cuomo the governor of new york said america wasn't great
dan rodimer
dan rodimer
dan rodimer

dana please stand up
democrat-run radical left-wing democrat usually run
did you see the statistics of us compared to other countries

don't do it
don't mess with him
don't mess with him
don't worry about a thing
endless wars
europe's excess mortality rate is 24% higher than the us and despite their very punitive lockdowns they're once again seeing very large spikes in cases unfortunately
even his secretary of defense his secretary of state they said he always voted the wrong way
even the woman that owns the beauty parlor turned her in

every place endorsed me

everything he's done was wrong
everything is a possibility
extreme late-term

for 47 years biden crushed the dreams of american workers to enrich foreign countries
for the entire summer biden was silent as left-wing mobs assaulted police officers
for the last four years i've been delivering for our incredible hispanic community i'm fighting for school choice safe neighborhoods low taxes low regulations on all hispanic-owned small business and they are great business people
for years you had a president who apologized for america
from carson city to elko from las vegas to reno from minden to right here in henderson we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded american patriots who poured out their heart sweat and soul to secure our liberty and defend our great freedom

he always voted the wrong way
he can't be your president
he didn't act fast
he doesn't care
he doesn't discriminate
he doesn't even know what fracking is i guarantee you
he even put this whack job he even put beto o'rourke beto
he got caught
he had muscles on muscles on muscles
he has no clue what's happening to that poor city
he is a great fighter
he is so smart so tough so cunning
he looked like it would be impossible to beat
he opposed the killing of soleimani
he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden
he opposes the death penalty for the boston bomber
he oversaw the rise of isis and he cheered the rise of china as a positive development for america and the world
he said 
he said 
he said he's going to knock him out
he should have closed it earlier
he supports taxpayer-funded extreme late-term abortion

he wants to close prisons and he even called law enforcement the enemy recently
he wants to cut your vet facilities in half go to socialized healthcare and end 180 million americans' private healthcare plans which they love
he wants to give prisoners a vote
he wants to have the boston bomber be able to vote
he wants to take care of his fighters and he brought some of them along the best
he was looking for a place and they said 
he was off shoring your jobs throwing open your borders depleting our military and sacrificing your children's future to china and other faraway lands
he was there recently
he was told to say that by bernie and the radical left and his vice president
he was totally against closing
he wasn't a fighter
he went all throughout the debates
he will destroy protections for preexisting conditions and decimate your 401s your retirement system your stocks he'll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal illegal aliens
he won it twice
he would allow left-wing anarchies to burn down your businesses
he would hand over your jobs to china and your country to the socialists and beyond the socialists
he would make it impossible for you to compete
he'll never have the strength and he's going downhill fast
he's against free speech
he's an animal
he's an animal and i called him an animal and i was criticized by people calling him an animal
he's been a friend of mine for a long time i've been a friend of his but i gave him a place a long time ago
he's been there for 47 years and you know that he's been there until three and a half years ago
he's fighting a tough customer but i don't know
he's going home to mom
he's got some champions with him tonight
he's here
he's not a human being
he's not a human being
he's pledged to wage attacks on catholic organizations like the little sisters of the poor
he's shot
he's tough he's smart he can be vicious but he's just fair more than anything else
here's a man he used to walk into that ring and he still does and he's as good as there is in the world
hey brandon art pick out your toughest guy i want to see whether or not he can take colby in a fight
hey could you keep it away from a football game
him and his brother fredo
his first statement was anti all of the things but it was really anti-gun anti-second amendment
his first statement was anti religion
his first statement was anti-fracking anti-energy
his ratings aren't very good so you probably don't
how about that
how about the flag burning
how about the other day
hundreds of officers nationwide have been injured in left-wing riots and mobs
i agree actually but i don't think i'm allowed to say it
i always say it's a great sport
i can say that this man is totally unfit to be president
i couldn't believe what you did
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know but they are great
i don't know if he's going to get away with that one
i don't know if it's that easy
i don't see any of the people male or female sitting in this audience that wants that job ice
i don't think he has a clue
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think your state is into that
i get so angry
i go comma again
i got a reel on him
i got to introduce him
i kept my promise recognized the true capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
i know really bad people
i know some developers in new york actually
i know what happens to him
i love that city
i love this state
i mean here it is
i mean they're in very grave condition as you know
i mean what do we have
i mean you know you're presiding over the greatest economy in history and a group of very smart people walk in and say 
i mean you've seen it all the way
i must tell you at great peril i used them seldom but those are the times we have the best fun too i will say
i never saw muscles
i really mean that
i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and we've achieved the two historic peace deals in the middle east in just the last month two two
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i saved the u
i see so many things and i see all these businesses computers you come up with a new chip you come up with a new computer you come up with a new laptop
i spoke with the governor of oregon and they've never had anything like it
i think dana white could have made a slightly better deal than that
i think i've gotten every major law enforcement group in the country right
i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's rapid theft of american jobs
i want a drug test because we don't want to have a situation like we could have with this guy
i want to just thank them
i want to just thank you all i want to thank you all
i want to thank brandon judd who's here and art del cueto
i want to thank you
i want to thank you don
i wanted it closed and nobody else did
i was months early
i was way early
i watched him in debates with other 24 lunatics and he was so bad
i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal
i would love to have a law
i would love to see it
i would love to see it
i would love to see it
i would love to see it
i'll be going to california tomorrow
i'll be honest
i'll be watching you better believe it
i'll be with you all the way
i'm just very honored by it
i'm sorry
i'm what you need
i'm xenophobic
i've gotten to know president putin of russia
i've gotten to know president xi of china
i've spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to america securing our borders rebuilding our military and standing up to china like no other president has ever done
if biden wins china wins
if biden wins the mob wins
if i were a congressman or senator i'd be in there with that one
if something would happen where he'd get in and there's a headwind believe it or not that stock market would be much higher but there's a headwind on the possibility okay
if they were lucky they'd just be thrown out
if this were reversed they would be in jail for two years already and it would be for a 50-year term for treason
if we don't win michigan after all those auto plants and i don't know but it's been tough but we won it last time
if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands more americans would have died just by that one move alone
if we wouldn't have closed it we would've been talking two and a half or three million
if you think it's easy for these guys
if you want your second amendment if you want life if you want so many other things even having to do with your military even having to do with your vets if you want things if you want you've got to have the court
in a second term i'll provide school choice to every parent in america
in fact you didn't hear it because they don't report this
incredible
instead of letting washington change us despite all that we've been through we are changing washington
it has to go through a big process
it is
it said 
it was a made up statement and they put it up in the form an ad from a third-rate magazine who's best friend is obama who by the way got caught spying on my campaign
it was closed they had grass growing in the runways grass growing in the runways
it was like an easy day at the office
it was taken care of in 15 minutes
it wasn't even a contest
it went a few rounds
it would probably be a lot rougher than that
it would take us less than a half an hour
it would've been so bad
it'll be amazing to see
it'll never get old
it's a favored nations clause i signed
it's all down
it's all down in tape
it's all political
it's all political
it's all political
it's called disinformation
it's called the manifesto
it's crazy
it's crazy
it's crazy what's going on
it's destined for a fate of doom and despair
it's far too much
it's going to be announced very soon
it's going to be very interesting
it's got to stop it's got to stop now
it's just not the same
it's like the biggest we've ever had
it's not easy but they felt that they had an obligation to do it
it's not him
it's okay because now the gloves are off
it's really a vote for the american dream
it's right before the election but i think i'm going to be watching okay
it's the american dream versus the american nightmare
it's too violent
it's very interesting
jim thank you very much
joe biden brought you only endless wars i'm bringing you peace and i'm bringing our troops back home
joe biden has spent the last 47 years selling out america
joe biden he's shot and everybody knows it
joe calls for abolishing cash bail and closing your prisons

now he's trying to change his mind
now i say 
now if we had 10 people against that one those 10 people would be in serious trouble
now it's the number one space center in the world by far
now joe biden cannot lead our country because he really doesn't believe truly in our country
now let's see what happens
now really look it's okay
now the republicans it's interesting we have much better policy but the republicans they don't fight like colby

or whether we'll allow joe biden and the group of handlers to impose a $4 trillion tax hike ban american energy destroy our suburbs demolish our second amendment and indoctrinate your children with a poisonous anti-american lie
other countries are doing terribly
others say 
others say 
our american ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are going to make it greater than ever before
our country will never be the same
our movement is pro-jobs pro-worker pro-police and 100% pro-american

s
see these things
she is the worst
she thought it was disgraceful but that's what we're dealing with a bunch of phonies
she turned her in
she's a great person kimberly guilfoyle
she's considered far more liberal than bernie sanders
she's tough but she's very kind
shot him killed him
should have left a long time ago
should he entitled
sir we have to close it
so biden wants to appease the domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists
so get your friends get your family get your neighbors get your coworkers and on november 3rd or sooner get out and vote
so good for israel
so good that we did that
so i was very honored
so in concluding this wonderful afternoon and again don thank you very much but in concluding this wonderful afternoon and if the governor comes after you which he shouldn't be doing i'll be with you all the way
so in the republican party we know that police officers are not villains but the heroes who risk their lives to keep us safe
so it just happened
so it's not like 
so many
so once he did that i said 
so one of the best fighters in the world and he's got a tremendous fight coming up against i guess the number one rated pound for pound fighter justin gaethje
so they actually said 
so they asked him 
so we had many sites by the way all exterior sites all outside
so we let the anarchists know that we were going in with approximately 10000 very tough people and they immediately raised their hands and the seattle police who by the way could do a great job if they were let to do their job but they're not they're not
so we're backing you all the way
so we're going to be there tomorrow
so we're joined tonight by two terrific congressional candidates that have been just incredible in the job they've done
so you got to get out on november 3rd or early voting

thanks to our powerful new security measures we've doubled the amount of meth seized at the border over the last year we've doubled
that fire we'll put out
that means everybody that's in prisons should be entitled to a vote right
that sounds good
that to me is a really big deal
that to me is really a big deal
that was an easy one
that was by the way that was the most depressing convention
that was not an easy one
that'd be easy money
that's a big deal
that's a great deal
that's a much easier fire to put out
that's going to be an incredible fight
that's going to haunt him
that's going to haunt him
that's joe biden
that's more money than we could make in a thousand years a hundred trillion dollars
that's not freedom of speech
that's not too bad
that's not too bad dana
that's true
that's true
that's very good that's very good
that's what happened
that's what happened to him
that's what it is
that's what it is
that's what it would be
that's what they should do
that's what we're doing
that's what you're going to have
that's what's happened
that's what's happening
that's where they're coming from
that's where they're coming from
the arsonists and flag burners
the democrat party also continues to attack our incredible border agents more than half of whom happen to be hispanic americans
the democrats and biden would be a disaster for hispanic americans
the drug companies do not like me too much
the enemy until his polls started dropping
the ice agents dana could sign some of them up the ice agents they go into like a pack
the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in from china
the job they've done in their campaign
the official union of our nation's incredible border patrol agents
the other administration would have been years and we're almost there
the owner of the chicago cubs and he's in first place so he's very happy the rnc finance chairman todd ricketts
the people that push him around don't believe in our country because he agreed to a manifesto with crazy bernie right
the president of the united states just placed two bets justin and colby
the radical left in america is waging open war on law enforcement
the thousands and tens of thousands of good things nobody talks about it
the united states has experienced the smallest contraction of any major western nation and the fastest recovery by far
the windows are too big
then all of a sudden he said 
then all of a sudden now i see him saying 
there will be no fracking
there's a headwind
there's no reason for this and we have the greatest police
there's nobody like this guy i'm telling you
these are criminals and they do it like it's routine
these are great people that have done a great job and we have to support our law enforcement
these people don't know what they're getting into
they actually said that america was never great
they actually said that america wasn't great
they are great great heroes of mine of yours of everybody's
they beat people that were very good very talented great politicians and they won
they call them peaceful protestors
they could have done that
they didn't do it
they didn't put america first
they didn't take care of our country but we're taking care of our country
they didn't want that to happen and we let the protestors know or whatever you call them
they don't fight like colby
they don't fight to win
they don't like nancy pelosi
they don't want help
they endorsed me and they're against their radical left culture that's destroying the city
they go at a pack
they go into a pack of ms-13 fighters
they just don't know how violent the american people are do they
they just don't want to report it but they nominated your president twice last week on two different subjects for a nobel prize
they knew we were going in to seattle
they love our country
they love our country
they made it up
they make up a total lie they put it out then they do ads
they may not count your ballot
they never endorse
they never quite figured that out
they ought to be ashamed because they do interviews with him they give him the questions and they let him read the answer from a teleprompter and that's the fake news
they paid $150 billion 1
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said he's a human being
they should have stopped it in china
they stopped it from going into china but they didn't stop it from going into our country europe and the rest of the world
they take out thousands and thousands of ms-13 killers a year and bring them the hell back out of our country
they want people to come across but they want them to come across legally
they'll be running the department of justice the department of homeland security
they'll say 
they'll say 
they'll say 
they're all coming back
they're all democrats
they're fighting him
they're great
they're not allowed
they're not doing well
they're not supposed to do it but they did it anyway they endorsed me
they're only doing it to affect your november 3rd great election
they're put on as young people and they stay a long time
they're putting the lives of our brave officers directly in harm's way
they're ready to fight
they're really anarchists they're not protestors
they're very sharp
they're weak ineffective people let's face it
they've never had a clip like this with the jobs and everything else
think of it
this guy what the hell has he done
this is a word that starts with a c not and s
this is the most important election in the history of our country
this place is packed
this way i can't get in trouble
thousands and thousands and thousands of acres
thousands of loyal hard-working great american patriots

when biden's far-left supporters set fire to police cars and precinct stations court houses joe biden called them peaceful protestors

you burn the flag you go to jail for one year
you burn the flag you should go to jail for one year
you can use my building don
you come back in a thousand years a wall and a wheel
you don't hear this
you don't want that job
you don't want to pick a fight with him at a bar
you ever watch fredo
you got to get out and vote
you got to get them in
you got to hear this
you got to open up your state
you have a governor right now who's a political hack
you hear that colby
you hear that justin
you know i put a lot of money in this state and it's been a great investment
you know just so you know these shutdowns we did the right thing
you know that
you know that
you know the next president probably will have anywhere one two three or four supreme court justices
you know there aren't many states that are shut down
you know they say 
you know they'll say 
you know we have a little expression 
you know what
you know what we got for it
you know who colby is
you know who said that
you know who's thought of that
you know why
you know why it's called the manifesto
you know your governor
you remember what they did to that guy
you saw recently i got new york's finest
you saw that
you say 
you see it
you see it you see it all the time
you see the numbers
you see what's happening
you're going to say hello to colby
you're talking about serious money and that money is not used for good reasons
you're with us and where we are with you
you've had presidents they never put america first
your 401k's are doing very well
your former attorney general adam laxalt
your stocks are doing very well
$1 billion
$52 trillion
10500 it's packed
11000
25%
a beautiful thing is happening right to try
a guy who was always there for us john joyce
a man that's been a friend of mine for a long time mike kelly
a wonderful man who represents this area scott perry
about a month before i ran i picked up a new york times it was like a leaflet that you had out at a grocery store and now it's thick
above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america one great country
after years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation
after years of waiting many many years many many decades they've been looking for this and then we got it done and we've been waiting for a long time for nancy pelosi to announce usmca and she did it on the same day that they announced that they are going to impeach the 45th president of the united states and your favorite president i think
ah lisa i hope you're miss him
all because barack obama gave us 142 empty seats
all of a sudden our steel mills are doing again
all of a sudden the time will be up
all of it
all of the things i said 
all of these horrible things remember
all right
all right we're joined tonight by many of the terrific warriors that have helped me so much in so many ways
also with us tonight pennsylvania trump victory chairwoman bernie
am i lucky i had it transcribed
america is thriving like never before
america is winning again like never before
and all i did was buy some stock
and as i always say and i've already said it twice tonight this country is so respected and we were not respected four years ago we were laughed at
and as i said african american hispanic american asian american unemployment the lowest ever in the history of our country the lowest unemployment rates
and by the way he his foreign minister everybody did you know they said 
and by the way the senate's been so professional so good so strong so solid
and by the way the whistleblower the whistleblower defrauded our country because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue and we broke up the game
and by the way we build the greatest weapons the greatest planes the greatest ships we build it in the united states there's nobody that comes close
and by the way you know they talk about the elite
and do you people out there i'm sorry it's pretty rough
and don't forget look at the floor and then you go out
and everything's built right here in the united states
and guatemala honduras and el salvador we signed a very important agreement with each
and he was quickly replaced by his second-in-command and his second-in-command is now dead
and hello pennsylvania
and henry j
and i got it approved so you can sign a document get it
and i hate to tell you this when i was campaigning three and a half years ago i'd come here you weren't doing so well folks
and i have to say this look and i always have to say this you have some really great journalists and you have some honest publications but not too many of them i have to be honest with you
and i know his grandfather i shouldn't say that to you
and i love pennsylvania
and i'm thrilled to report that we are on the verge of ending the nafta catastrophe once and for all
and in 2020 i'm going to work like hell that we take over the house
and it was you know to me impeachment is a very ugly word
and it wouldn't be much different in the state of pennsylvania that i can tell you
and just a few weeks ago the united states special forces brought the world's number one terrorist to justice
and now after and a half years now that the russia witch hunt is dead a big fat disgusting fraud the congressional democrats are pushing the impeachment witch hunt having to do with ukraine but that's already failing
and now more importantly than anything wages are up for the first time in many many years decades decades
and proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
and remember this al-baghdadi was the founder of isis al-baghdadi was a vicious ruthless person al-baghdadi created a caliphate bigger than the state of ohio
and right here in pennsylvania we've created 160 000 brand new beautiful jobs and you have companies moving in and moving back
and right now we're by far the largest economy in the world
and she knew what would happen
and some of these partisan lunatics have already said that if they fail this time think of this
and that means jobs that means 401ks
and that's one of the very big reasons why our i think that and regulations but that's one of the very big reasons why our economy is doing so well because they talk about our consumer is loaded with money
and that's the only way they can do it
and that's what's been happening for the last two and a half years
and the fbi also sent multiple undercover human spies to surveil and record people associated with our campaign
and the first thing they almost always say 
and the reason they announced it on the same day one hour later they announce impeachment a few guys standing behind her
and then the informer who is the informer
and then they announce there was no bias
and then when you add energy savings and you add tax savings you have almost a $10000 gain in three years
and then you wonder why we have so many people trying to come through at the borders
and there's no other word
and they advertise 
and they come right from the state of pennsylvania
and they didn't know what we were talking about but they said 
and they will
and think of it this way also the silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt that's the reason they approved usmca
and this report was great by the ig especially since he was appointed by president barack hussein obama
and today we set a new record almost 160 million people are working
and two people that you all know very well in this state they bring home the bacon dan meuser and fred keller
and u
and we call them up and we said 
and we had the biggest crowds
and we have other things we're going to do that are incredible
and we have our new phrase because we've made america great
and we have regulation and you need some regulation but you don't need regulation that doesn't allow you to build a simple road or highway
and we live by the words of our national motto 
and we now have taken 100% of the caliphate and we have thousands and thousands of isis prisoners
and we're doing well with the deal but they want to make a deal
and we've got our eye on and our sights on third also we know exactly where and when but it's becoming a very unpopular job not a lot of takers and that's what we want
and while it was tough on my family i have to say very unfair to my family very tough on my family
and yet he saying 
and you don't have your doctor
and you know he's never leaving don't you
anyway here in pennsylvania you had the single best year that you've ever had in the history of our country not bad
aoc plus three
are you better off now than you were four years ago
as we speak a criminal illegal alien with three prior deportations is roaming free in pennsylvania because he was released by the city of philadelphia the city of brotherly love
at first i thought he was kidding
because over the last three years you see the stock market set 131 records from the day
because people now can not only make a lot more money if they don't like their job they go out and they get a different job and they get more money and ultimately they find one that they love
because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
because they want to win an election
because they're fake
because together we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america proud again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again
because we've let them know the price is very bad if they don't do that
believe me if i weren't a good developer you could forget about that wall
beto beto
bribery and this and that
but any democrat that votes for this sham will be voting to sacrifice their house majority their dignity and their career
but beyond defense they always say the most important thing you can do is judges and justices of the supreme court
but but i have to tell you as bad as it is it meant something
but conan the dog got more than i did and that's okay
but day after day we're exposing something called that filthy disgusting horrible swamp and we're cleaning it up
but far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities demonstrating their sneering contempt scorned and disdained for everyday americans
but he didn't want to say that
but he doesn't want to say it
but he said he's not ever going to become president and strzok look back 
but honestly it's an incredible deal for our country
but i have so many people 401ks are through the roof your jobs are through the roof we have the lowest unemployment rate
but i'm not going too far with any of these people because i thought i was way too early with elizabeth warren
but it screwed up the whole works because most guys would never do that
but it's like when you plant a tree it needs time to grab on
but just quickly here are the facts on shifty schiff
but no there's never been anything like it
but now we're stronger politically than we were ever before
but she's going back down again
but that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion
but the impeachment hoax is about overturning your great 2016 vote or in the alternative trying to win the 2020 election
but the voters of this commonwealth will never ever let that happen
but the whistleblower is gone
but the word impeachment to me is a very very ugly word
but then she opened that fresh mouth of hers and it stopped
but these are only the cases we know about
but they all say 
but they all say that
but they always say 
but they said they'll do it again because this has been a total bust
but they're all looking at the same thing
but this has never happened
but today the house democrats announced these two flimsy pathetic ridiculous articles of impeachment
but together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration
but unlike those politicians i keep my promises
but we do a great job
but we're building it and it's fine and we have the money coming in from the military
but we've all done the great job
but we've also created 7 million new jobs since the election
but we've done a good job in many ways
but what we've done for our vets what we've done in rebuilding our military what we've done in so many ways and we unlike the democrats will protect your second amendment
but while we're delivering historic victories for the american people the radical left democrats and the failed washington establishment are trying to erase your votes nullify the election and overthrow our democracy
but with the help of everyone here we have now the hottest economy
but you know somebody that believes in that is sleepy joe biden
buttigieg
by the way russia wishes that hillary clinton won
by the way to this day there has never been and they'll always correct me in the history of politics in the history of our country there has never been anybody that drew crowds like we draw and i don't have a guitar
by the way was that the most exciting night ever
by the way you may have the worst district attorney or whatever the hell you call it
can i get a beer
can you believe he's doing well
can you believe we found these texts
can you imagine a guy coming in whether it's him or anybody else
come on up
come on up lawrence
come up here
come up mike
comfort
conan was almost electrocuted he deserves it
congratulations on the great job you've done with economy
congress will soon vote on my new trade deal the us-mexico-canada agreement or usmca
considering that fact it was great because we learned a lot of things that nobody would have found out variously although i suspect we would have
crazy elizabeth warren or as i affectionately call her pocahontas her ridiculous plan would cost $52 trillion
crazy things are happening in the democrat party
darling
darling
darling i want to watch television tonight and there's no damn wind
darling it's great to see you
darling there's no wind
david
democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
democrats are pushing for a socialist takeover of healthcare that would strip you of the doctor and coverage of your choice
democrats stand for crime corruption and chaos
democrats' sanctuary cities also give safe haven to those who commit violent sex crimes
desperate that donald trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being the united states president
did anybody see her beer deal where she said 
did you ever see such a phony disgusting deal
did you ever see that deal
did you know that
did you see that
did you see the virginia governor
dishonest guy makes up my statements
do you know who that is
do you know who that is
does anybody think the media is honest
does anybody think they're totally corrupted and dishonest
don't get in the fight with mike
don't land
even if you don't like them vote for them
even joking about it
everybody
everybody i think
everybody knows who that is
federal government wants to take them out or in some cases if it's real violence and we don't want to pay for the cost but we do put them into very strong jails
fired over 8000 people that were disrespecting our vets
folks they spied on our campaign they spied
for generations american manufacturing was the bedrock of your economy the bedrock
for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
four ms-13 gang members were also arrested in pennsylvania in connection with the brutal and sadistic murders of a 21-year-old and a 15-year-old
gee we'll get it from another country
get her out
get her out
get her out
get them out
get them the hell out of our country right
global warming
go back to living a good normal life because america is winning again
going to school here we never heard about sanctuary cities did we
got to take over the house mike
great ones
guess what
guy's a total corrupt guy
he comes up to a microphone now he comes up to a microphone like two and a half years ago 
he didn't do anything wrong
he flew the coop because he reported incorrectly and the ig who didn't want to look at the conversation he was so anxious to turn the whistleblower report over to congress so that congress could have fun with it ought to be ashamed of himself
he honestly believes that
he is totally serious
he just raises his hand he has no clue what he's doing
he just said that the democrats who are corrupt refuse to say that and that's ultimately the only one that matters the leaders of ukraine because they're the ones that know of this pressure not some crooked ambassador that's a deep stater or that's a bushy or that's a clintonite or that's a barack obama ambassador
he said 
he said 
he said they were lucky to have him as president
he was a tremendous man dan tabas but i'm going to introduce somebody that dan always said had tremendous talent
he was caught telling a far left radical activist that he would shut down fossil fuel production in pennsylvania
he'll walk up to the mic 
he's a whack job
he's disappeared
he's gone
he's gone
he's like the leading fundraiser
he's never leaving
he's smart he's tough
he's the governor of virginia and why the republicans aren't going to win virginia this next election 2020
heinz

how's that hat working out
i can't imagine they won't endorse because without me winning you know what happens

i didn't want to do interviews they were a waste of time
i disagree
i do it i do it
i don't care about press
i don't get it
i don't know
i don't know if it's true
i don't know keep away
i don't know should we give it a shot
i don't see her as a threat
i don't think she makes it
i don't think she's seen him in 10 years
i don't think so
i don't think somebody coming into pennsylvania you know those new petrochemical plants they don't like them at all
i dream about him
i give her credit
i have absolute proof that the president of the united states conspired with russia
i have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance
i have no guitar
i have so many people that come up to me 
i have stock in a 401k and you made me into a genius sir
i have to say i'm kidding because the fake news back there will take that
i know it well

i left these guys alone
i like hershey chocolate
i look forward to bull durham's report that's the one i look forward to
i love hershey
i love hershey
i love that hat
i love you like i've never loved anyone
i mean he gave a whole expose
i mean i know philadelphia well
i mean if you took ronald reagan and we all like ronald reagan i liked him i thought he was a great guy but if he came to pennsylvania for a rally if he had 1000 people in a ballroom or something you know
i mean look at this
i mean we're getting crowds 25-30000 people and then there'll be 20000 people outside
i mean who could believe a thing like that
i mean who is better off now
i mean you don't know
i mean you have alfred e

i recognize israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
i said 
i say we've done so much in the first three years will soon be four years
i think it's global warming
i think the most important thing we can do is defense
i think you could be abraham lincoln and not win that particular race
i thought i knocked her down
i told you about judges
i want clean water crystal clean i want and that's what we have at a record level
i want to also bring back our pennsylvania party chairman
i want to watch the election results

i withdrew from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal a disaster
i wouldn't lose too much sleep over it
i'd like to force him to say it
i'll tell you law enforcement is so great
i'll tell you what we're going to give it a very strong shot
i'm just watching these people that was one of the greatest evenings in the history of television from a rating standpoint from an excitement standpoint what the hell would they do without me and you
i'm only kidding
i'm only kidding
i'm only kidding
i'm only kidding part
i'm telling you about so many other things
i've been your spokesman and i've done a good job as spokesman
i've got here there there
i've got it from here from there from there
i've told you stock market we've rebuilt our military we've cut your taxes at a level that nobody could even think possible
ice warned and said 
if he's in pennsylvania 
if i would have said that the fake news would have gone crazy they would have said that's impossible
if the mother decides no then they execute the baby
if we had a murderer from honduras guatemala el salvador we want to bring them back under past administrations
if you remember you could look if you go back five six seven years in 2019 they say china was going to catch us as the world's largest economy
if you want to see the lives that we're saving it's a beautiful thing
if you want your children to inherit the birthright of american liberty that generations of americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020 and we have to get rid of the democrats in the house of representatives
in addition to replacing nafta i've taken the toughest ever action against china's trade abuses
in god we trust
in michigan in wisconsin in a place called pennsylvania
in other words i made here like a thing like right to try nobody talked about right to try
in the state of pennsylvania natural gas production is up 34% since our election 34
incredible
incredible deal and replacing the worst nafta
instead of handing them over while still in jail they defied ice
is that good
isn't that terrible
it always bothers me they said 
it could have started
it gets one of the biggest applause of anything it's the sixth branch of the united states armed forces the space force
it is so sad to see
it is the largest investment in pennsylvania history
it says that there are no crimes
it stopped
it used to be a sane party
it was always good
it was their phony insurance policy
it wasn't a pretty picture
it will never ever happen
it'll never come back
it's a dark ugly word
it's a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment because they are embarrassed by the impeachment and our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment
it's a word i associate with some very bad times in our country
it's about her husband
it's beyond that
it's great to be an iowa tonight
it's great to be back in this state that gave us the liberty bell pennsylvania steel hershey chocolate
it's greater than ever before
it's like 
it's not even like an impeachment
it's not like you could say 
it's one thing but very tough on a family thing a thing like this happens it's a disgrace
it's the only way
it's the survival
it's true
it's true
it's wonderful to be in the state of delaware
judges and supreme court justices
just a few months ago i visited the new shell petrochemical plant in beaver county at $6 billion with a b $6 billion

one of the animals accused was previously released by local authorities in defiance of an ice demand
only this way can we save the america we love and clean up washington corruption once and for all
only way
or no issue have the democrat politicians more thoroughly betrayed the american people than on the issue of immigration
other than that he was a very nice person
our air and our water are cleaner now than it's ever been with all that we're doing and we haven't closed up all of our industry and we haven't closed up our businesses and lost all those jobs
our polls have gone over the last month they've gone through the roof
our secretary of state made the call 
party of abe lincoln
payments
pennsylvania is the place where strong american workers mine the coal work the railroads and forge the steel that made america into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world and we are making it even greater every single day
pennsylvania is the state that gave us self-made titans of american industry from andrew carnegie to milton hershey
pennsylvania's the place where our founding fathers declared american independence where the army weathered its brutal winter at valley forge and where general george washington led his men across the delaware on christmas night
peter i love you
peter strzok and his lover lisa page
philadelphia has defied ice and released illegals charged with everything from assault to kidnapping to drug crimes to sex crimes to homicide murder

representative glenn thompson come up here glenn
representative lloyd smucker
republicans stand for law and order and we stand for justice
republicans will defend your sacred right to choose the doctor and you can choose your plan and you choose the plan that's right for you
right
right
right
right to try
russia
russia is number three
s
sanctuary cities and jails actively conceal illegal alien crime and criminals from federal government
sanctuary city
sat it
say it
say it you crooked bastard say it
see these guys want to be so politically correct you get her out
she always thought i was a total stiff a dumb stupid dope
she knew
she knew what was going to happen
she loves me so much more than she ever did
she rose then she became strong
she thinks i'm a genius
she wanted to smother the impeachment crap and that's probably what she did at least to an extent
she wants to be one of the group
she was raped and killed strangled to death
should we do a poll
should we do the poll
shows you the power of money right
since montgomery county maryland declared itself a sanctuary jurisdiction in july we have already identified nine illegal aliens who have been arrested for rape sexual assault including a 26-year-old man charged with raping and viciously strangling a young wonderful woman who was entering her apartment innocently entering her apartment
sir congratulations on your economy
so beautiful right
so far it could happen because you know i was doing six and seven a day that last month that last beautiful month that i loved i was doing six
so fbi lawyer lisa page so in love that she didn't know what the hell was happening texted the head of counter intelligence peter strzok likewise so in love he couldn't see straight
so he wanted to get rid of religion the bible he wanted to get rid of guns and he wanted to get rid of oil
so i just want to thank this is an amazing group of people and with their help and the help of everyone here we are going to set records like we've never set before
so i want to ask a couple of our great warriors to come forward
so respected
so she came back
so solid
so that's okay with me because they approved it and they're very happy to have it
so the democrats have nothing and they've turned the somber process of impeachment
so the informer obviously gave him a false information because they wrote in the whistleblower report they wrote something totally different from what i said what i said was perfect
so we have the greatest phrase in the history of politics make america great again
so we have to vote these crazy people the hell out of office
so we've done a job and we're proud of it and we have tremendous people
so what pelosi did and as i said they do the impeachment then right away let's do usmca right on top of it
so what we've done has been incredible
so you don't know
some had eight years one had more than eight years
some of these people with these crazy laws that you have
sorry
speaking of court we will soon have 182 federal judges including court of appeals

you know he's going to win
you know he's going to win
you know he's going to win don't you
you know how much press i got
you know i used to say and i sort of still have to say 2016 i don't know if anything like that can ever happen but i think we're much better
you know it
you know that right
you know this person
you know this right
you know we're dealing with some very bad people
you know what
you know what the password was
you know what's happening with your families
you know what's happening with your jobs
you know when i meet dictators and presidents and kings and queens and prime ministers they all come into that beautiful oval office
you know who are the elite
you know why
you know why
you look at it take a look at it it came out today
you look at school choice for every child in america who needs it including the 50000 pennsylvania students who your democrat governor has blocked from getting school choice scholarships
you look at those jobs reports
you need a magic wand
you remember four years ago i was here and i told people i said 
you saw that
you saw their so-called articles of impeachment today people are saying they're not even a crime
you see that
you weren't doing so well
you won't
you won't be able to do it
you'd have windmills all over the place if you had crooked hillary
you'd think she'd wait like a day
you're here
you're lucky we have ice
you're playing with us
you're talking about not paying the price for rape for murder for other horrible crimes
you're the elite
you're the elite
you're the elite
you're the elite
you're the elite
you're the elite
you've never had a time like this
you've never had that better year
your politicians always pledged to fix it
10000 a year

a branch the army the air force
a doctor
a friend of mine and a very good golfer by the way captain mike he rode a bike
a lot of people
a lot of people again fake news i think will agree to it
a lot of these people have been here for three days
a lot of times it's not worth it but i got to fight for fairness
a man who had a juror who was a radical anti-trump person and she didn't say that when she went up there and she became the foreperson of the jury and she did terrible things and said terrible things
a movie made in south korea what's this all about
a record number of 217 federal judges who will interpret the constitution as written
a story
above all we will never stop fighting for this
actually
actually sir
aero ab stoddard whoever that is
african american unemployment hispanic american
african american youth unemployment has reached an all time historic low
after the debate he went backstage fired a lot of people
after three years of ridiculous witch hunts and partisan democrat crusades
after years of building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country
ain't that true
al baghdadi is dead
al baghdadi is dead
al-baghdadi
alfred e
all i know it said 1% and an arrow left
all of a sudden he wins the academy award so fitting
all of the radical democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth
all paid for by the taxpayers of the united states
all right
all right i'm sorry
all these computers they said 
am i right
america is no longer for sale
america is thriving like never before
america lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the wto the world trade organization
and a lot of the democrats are going to ruin the healthcare programs that these unions have
and as the wall gets longer it gets easier and easier
and border patrol has seized the largest amount just recently of deadly narcotics ever recorded
and by the way the union i have a lot of respect for that union
and by the way we got the olympics coming back or coming to los angeles
and by the way you know who understands the border because we are building that wall like crazy
and by the way you saw today single best day i've ever had is the polls and any poll that the fake news gives you because the real numbers are higher but any poll they give you as a fake
and could you imagine you take biden's son
and even the cas
and for some reason you know sometimes you do say it's not a big deal
and he wasn't too good
and hello las vegas
and i deal with them they like me
and i did that
and i said 
and i said 
and i said let me get back to washington do it early
and i said no i'm going to run for president
and i think we're going to have tremendous success
and i took the heat
and i was never a fan of brad pitt i will tell you that
and i'd like to have maybe one of you come up and just say a few words about coach brooks because he was very very he was really a big he was a big heart on this team
and i'll tell you what you know who's happy about it
and if they do they probably wouldn't do it anyway because they don't want to go away from what they're doing which is crazy because it is they're doing very poorly
and it turned out we are having such unbelievable results
and it was upheld in the supreme court what we did
and it's really not obamacare anymore because when you get rid of the individual mandate it's no longer obamacare but we're going to terminate it
and ladies and gentlemen of nevada the best is yet to come together
and look at this guy come on
and mark burnett was great
and nobody wanted to do it because it's a little bit controversial and a lot of the drug companies don't exactly love it
and our guys played a practice game with them was it a couple of weeks before and i hate to tell you the score was 10 to 3 and the usa was not on top and this team was an incredible team and they went in and it was amazing but tomorrow marks the 40 years since the united states men's hockey team defeated then soviet union team in the 1980 olympics
and remember if i give you wrong numbers the fake news is going to have headlines
and she choked and she went out and got a report done
and she did that in the first month
and she knows more about that subject i think than anybody and she works hard and she doesn't need it
and she left the company
and she's mean isn't she
and she's smart
and so now you go and you sign a waiver and you get everything
and some of them had to be down to like at 91% and they didn't have many people and i can't really show up because many of those people are now great friends of mine
and some of them wrote 
and speaking of vice presidents and speaking also of reality television because it's the greatest show of all time right
and started telling everybody
and that is under siege in case you haven't noticed
and that makes 7 million new jobs since the election
and that was actually the time when i knew i was going to run
and that was another one
and that's what happens when you can't get the words out
and the fact is america is respected again
and the man came here
and the next time i did it again and again and again
and the people went crazy
and then i said to china 
and then she gets on and says what a bad guy i am
and then somebody hits you with a perfect phrase
and then the guy comes along said 
and then we have a system of judges thousands of judges all over the place
and then you have the tom
and they are worse than cnn
and they do badly
and they ended up today front page new york times
and they said 
and they spent $500 million on all of the problems it caused and we've really straightened it out but it's still lousy healthcare obamacare
and they were amazed
and they're owned by people that really are bad
and this is why i did it
and this isn't about casting this is about real life
and we are making it greater than ever before
and we celebrate one of the greatest moments in the history of sports
and we have appointed two great new supreme court justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh
and we just created the sixth branch of the american armed forces the space force 72 years 72 years
and we live by the words of our national motto in god we trust
and we will drain the swamp
and we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant its flag on mars
and we work it and make sure that you have everything you want
and we worked with the mayor of los angeles
and we're fighting to stop surprise medical bill and barron's is going to be very happy
and when you leave a company all of a sudden it doesn't do as well
and you have some great ones here michael
and you know how they caught her
and you know what else
and you know what i had celebrity apprentice i had the apprentice on for 14 seasons 14 seasons and they used to come to my office and they would kiss my ass
and you know why they didn't do it
and you put them on that broadcast their ratings would go up five fold but they don't know that
another place the exact same thing $2500
anyway so the show i said started at ten went to nine went to became it was the number one show all of a sudden and the agent called me up and he said sir i remember it was six in the morning
are we enthusiastic
are you with him
are you with him
are you with him
aren't people bored
as you heard we added another 225000 new jobs last month alone
asian americans likewise the lowest ever recorded
at stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation
barron woah
because he looked tough
because he was gasping for breath
because i am very surprised by it
because i have to get back to washington to work
because i'm for the working man and woman whether you're union or non-union
because it's just because we're stupid
because the fake whistleblower said that the call was totally different than what the call was
because they'll be out of business
because we're nine months away
because when i left and arnold schwarzenegger and i like arnold said some very nice things so i'm not but the show did not exactly succeed when i left but i had it on and they wanted me to sign for more and i said no i'm going to run for president but i'll never forget
because you know how they were paying a lot of money and whether you're rich or not it's still a lot of money
before i came along they all wanted a wall
before i came into office the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country poisoning our children including right here in a very big way
belated meaning i'm just kidding okay
believe it or not then we had even before the election in 2016
better than howdy doody
bigger than healthcare
bill baker
bill baker
bill come up
bobby
bobby i don't know
brilliantly to save three cents
bring back gone with the wind
bunch of dishonest people
but a lot of shots right
but a lot of the democrats want to do that
but abc is terrible and nbc is terrible and cbs is terrible
but all they do is give them heat
but as soon as i came in and i said 
but comcast is a rotten company
but he did say that
but he looked at me
but he said 
but he's looking at me
but here i was i signed with nbc and they didn't even want to waste the ink on an option
but how bout msdnc
but i have a problem
but i think that the unions are really with us and the unions have been with us
but if he came to las vegas you know they'd have a ballroom and they'd have 500 maybe a thousand people
but if they ever did a conservative broadcast meaning very fair very honest when i say that it's almost like do a fair broadcast
but it is true
but it's crazy
but jake tapper put out some things basically saying i believe it that's the way i read it that the new russian thing that started yesterday that putin wants to be sure that trump which give me a break
but jake tapper said it ain't so and if he did say that because they were a little complex they can turn them around or when zucker sees him and said 
but just tell them am i a good athlete and am i a good golfer
but let me just tell you he put out a couple of social media posts today because i never call it tweet i call it social media because it's much bigger than tweet
but let's say the fake news could give me enough phony stories enough bad stuff that we don't make it
but maybe that could be rick because they still don't have any idea what he got
but michael mcdonald i want to thank you and the members of the nevada republican central committee
but mike pence has been great
but no no she's mean
but now anybody sitting there reading this saying 
but now we have cag now we have cag
but one day i was in a big arena 25000 people packed before the election and i said 
but pocahontas was really mean but she's going to be easy
but speaking to vice presidents and speaking of perfect vice presidents if you become president the first thing you have to do is choose a really horrible horrible vice president
but tell me is it perfect casting the whole thing
but that'll kick in
but that's okay
but that's only 15% of the crowd right
but there are plenty of them out there
but these people are sick they are sick people
but they don't have a big name on it
but they don't realize it
but they had it on for three weeks
but they're great with the computers
but things like that happen a lot because after two three days it's not easy and these are strong people
but think of it they can take something like that a perfect phone call or they'll take just out of thin air they can make something up
but this crazy woman who's got zero going zero
but together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society
but was that the greatest game you've ever played
but we get them all
but we have a lot of time

i guess if i didn't do well with the show they wouldn't have been nice because they weren't nice to other people that failed
i guess it's called the swamp
i guess you call it trump derangement syndrome
i had a lot of other things to do the first year like fight off the democrats

i said to one of the big broadcasters i'm friendly with him
i said wait a minute
i said what's that all about
i said yeah okay
i said you didn't want me to do the show
i say 
i say 
i say it all the time
i say most important thing is defense
i see these phoneys
i shook the hand of somebody i have to
i signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices those same prices fall very fast
i spent 70 mini mike so far has spent almost $500 million dollars in order to get embarrassed by pocahontas
i think he might've even gone to jail for a period of time for doing something that was really very understandable
i think his wife likes him
i think in the old days you had to have licenses for this stuff right
i think so yeah
i think they're very bad for our country
i thought he was a great guy great president didn't like his policy on trade
i threw all the runs hates it
i told somebody the evening newscasts they're terrible for conservative people and they're crooked they're absolutely dishonest
i want every debate easily
i want that deleted and i want you to do a different one
i want to come to washington and help people get jobs
i want to get back
i want to make 20 forms of aspirin
i want to see those agreements
i wanted to save $2 total
i was in bed
i was just kidding
i was president elect then because the president didn't want to get involved
i was presidential
i was told a week ago
i was told that was happening
i will not say which ones
i will tell you that right now
i won every debate and maybe i don't know maybe one somebody but i won with tremendous numbers
i won them against crooked hillary
i won them in the primaries like 15 or 16 debates
i won they're all shouting
i won't say which countries but you know what other countries do
i won't tell you which one because i'll ruin it for you but his best song is the song that he thought would never make it the song that he liked the least but he said that's the one that was the most successful that the people like you never know
i would have done that
i would have said that's impossible
i wouldn't say that i exactly helped talking about the wall and other things but she left the company came to washington and she said 500000 jobs
i'd be the meanest man in history
i'd get them a host
i'd like now to invite these incredible sport legends to join me on stage
i'd love to see you because i think i'm entitled to more money
i'll never get rid of maga because i'm superstitious
i'll say how's the olympics going
i'll show you
i'll tell you something about cnn
i'll tell you that
i'll tell you what for our country that's why i like to see things that we do get honored because nobody is doing what we do
i'm busy dad
i'm glad they didn't do anything with it frankly because you know what to do for something like that
i'm looking
i'm making a lot of money with all that oil
i'm not a bad guy but it's really a disgrace
i'm not going to fight any of them okay
i'm not going to show results but i'm holding it up just quickly glancing
i'm not sure
i'm saying 
i'm the president of the united states pal
i've been saying that actually for two years
i've got to be very careful
i've got to order me one that i can ride around
ice officers arrested over 5 000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery rape and even murder
if an airplane goes down with 700 people they don't cover it
if i didn't see the results i wouldn't like it at all
if it's not trump related they don't cover it
if they use their genius because they are genius at that stuff right
if we didn't have them
if we weren't getting the results
if you build the wall you'll lose the hispanic vote
if you go to a hospital they won't even tell you how much it's going to cost
if you have bad ratings you can say 
if you have good ratings you can treat them like garbage
if you want to shut down sanctuary cities if you want to protect your family and your loved ones you must vote republican in 2020
if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november of 2020 november 3rd
if you would do a newscast that's conservative i'd get them a host
if you're terminally ill
if you're very very sick you're not going to make it
illegal immigration costs nevada taxpayers think of it more than $1
in colorado they're there three four days early
in my state of the union address i proudly declare that we are in the midst of the great american comeback and we're just getting started
in other words they said and this was in the new york times i said the other night in colorado
in the history of our country we have a lot of things that we've done to break records
in this region alone last year ice officers and they're patriots
in western nevada an illegal alien was charged with robbing and brutally executing four victims last year
incredible
infrastructure
is the greatest phrase
is there any place that's more fun than a trump rally
is this the greatest
isn't that something
it is fake news they're fakers
it sort of doesn't work quite as well
it still doesn't work
it was
it was a phenomenal and the final episode remember that
it was a tremendous success there
it was called the miracle on ice
it was fun
it was go on and then the show goes started at ten went to eight went to seven went to five went to four went to two
it was going to cost 50
it was going to cost 50
it was going to cost five
it was great
it was incredible
it was one phrase
it was slightly important
it was supposed to cost 5 million
it went to one
it would be too disrespectful
it's a big deal isn't it
it's a billboard
it's a caucus known as obamacare but we're running it much better than they did
it's a different kind of address
it's a lot
it's a lot
it's a lot
it's a recent
it's a very unfair system
it's actually less when they did the numbers
it's an interesting story
it's been incredible
it's called the swamp
it's disinformation
it's genius actually
it's going to be great
it's going to be very exciting today
it's got to be trump or trump related
it's got zero television personality
it's great
it's higher stiff
it's incredible
it's like a billboard right
it's no good
it's no good
it's no good
it's not going to be her
it's not me that's saying it
it's one of the only things he's done good in broadcasting but i signed and nbc as you know is owned by comcast but i signed and they figured the show would be a total failure
it's one of the reasons you voted for trump
it's peanuts
it's pretty amazing
it's right here in your place in las vegas right here
it's the greatest phrase
it's the greatest phrase ever used in politics
it's the only reason we would have won this state
it's too early
it's too early
it's tough
it's true
it's true
it's true
jobs are booming incomes are surging poverty is plummeting
just a fair broadcast
just a minor change
just don't worry
just like they were in iowa
just quick
just relax
just take it
just think of the song ymca
just turned 13

one is $39 one is $2500
one of the first things i did when i came in
one of the top in the country
only the real aficionados
only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all
or no issue of washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than the issue of immigration
other people don't have her drive
otherwise that's the last time i'm introducing you like that
our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring american liberty and ending the tyranny of federal bureaucrats
our military is rebuilt
our strategy worked
part of that number is all of the money that we save at the pump and on electric
people i love people i might've helped more than anybody because of choice and accountability

people that didn't have good ratings that business is a very simple business
people that weren't even thinking about coming

pocahontas
pocahontas
precedent
president barack hussein obama eight years $ 975
president bush eight years $450
president donald john trump three years
president trump said that obama should be impeached but he's not in office and so therefore they can't impeach
presidential not presidential
price transparency
price transparency and he looks at me
price transparency is a big deal
probably an even worse deal for us than nafta if that's possible but under my administration the great betrayal of america is over
probably means i won't get campaign contributions from certain people but i'm not going to get them anyway
probably the biggest agreement of any kind ever signed with china that will defend our workers protect our intellectual property and boost american exports by a lot
proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
red light just went off
remember he said 
remember i wanted to leave
remember my first question
remember president obama
remember they also said 
remember they said four years ago in the debates and you had this crazy woman
remember what i said i have more indian blood in me than she has and i have none
remember when he walked up to bernie the other day
remember when the democrats were saying 
remember when they did the three hours the whole night was the apprentice
remember when they had this was the greatest the $5 billion website right
remember you could keep your doctor
republicans are fighting for citizens from every background every community and every single walk of life
republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school

she forgot
she forgot that she lied about her own heritage
she got it figured out but most people can't but she does
she had a company that was selling shoes and everything you could sell

she is a green party candidate or was they said she's an agent of russia
she said 
she said 
she said 
she said she was an indian because she had high cheekbones

she'd just put her name on it and she said 
she's a mess
she's a zero
she's an incredible she's a doctor and she studies addiction and drugs drug addiction all sorts of addictions
she's got no talent got nothing
she's gotten these great companies like walmart and many others exxon she's gotten them to take millions of people
she's hitting me too hard
she's jumping up and down
she's nothing
she's nothing
she's now over 15 million jobs where they train people and bring them into the companies
she's probably got a little drive

thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row
that is why millions of registered democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement
that means probably i do have more
that means you think you miss him and you love him
that might happen to me someday
that nervous energy
that putin wants to make sure get elected
that they fought me like crazy because it's really showing if it works there it's really showing that it works
that thing would be the hottest show
that was a massive violation of the campaign finance laws but dinesh dinesh they wanted to put him in jail
that was her goal
that was incredible
that was one of my best answers
that was probably they say maybe the greatest team ever assembled
that was some goaltending right
that was the big deal
that was the only thing
that was unbelievable
that was when the russians had a team assembled
that's a beauty
that's all they think about
that's an old movie
that's exactly except for one thing we work our asses off and we are doing things like nobody has ever done before
that's funny
that's great
that's how she keeps getting on television
that's like one of the smaller businesses
that's my problem i don't want to take away any of our people
that's okay
that's okay
that's pencil neck pencil neck again
that's pretty good
that's really unfair
that's the big column on the right
that's the end of it
that's the end of that
that's the only thing they're good at
that's too hokey
that's true
that's true
that's what happens right
that's what they all said
that's why eventually they're going to support me
that's why i use the word belated impeachment
that's why if we are successful you don't want the supreme court to try and get rid of this the caucus
that's why we have caravans of people that we're turning back
the air force was 72 years ago
the anniversary
the average unemployment rate for my administration this is the coolest of them all is the lowest for any united states president in recorded history
the chairman of the nevada republican party who's really been great
the democrat party is the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total obliteration of your very very important second amendment
the democrats don't have to be but we have to be
the drug companies hate it
the fake news would not cover the equivalent of the titanic
the great dan scavino
the great state of nevada
the greatest reality show of all times times of million
the guy talks to me and he's working with his computer
the hispanics understand it and they don't want to be working and have people come and take their job
the hospitals don't love it but i got to do what's right for you
the kid got $3 million dollars 83000 a month and he didn't have a job until his father became vice president
the kids though
the largest amount
the lawyers meet them they get paid fees but we're breaking the system
the money spend it's not even thinkable and don't forget when we say come like in california the clown he says 
the movie was made in south korea
the national unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century and soon we're going to have that be a historic number like so many of the others
the new president will get all the credit for price transparency and he won't even know what the hell it is
the number that they spent $5 billion
the number was supposed to be under 2 million and we added 7 million
the only thing i know about both of them is they're not agent
the owners of comcast rotten company bad for our country very bad
the papers become so small
the people are terminally ill they're going to die
the people i don't care i'm not
the people of iran are happy and even the leaders of iran because the leaders of iran were afraid of him
the people that understand it the best are hispanic
the place went crazy
the radical left's attempts to poison our democracy and overturn the last election have totally ended in a big fat failure
the republican party has never been unified like it is today
the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and the late great abraham lincoln which everybody forgot
the same test
the thing was obsolete by the time it got approved
the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached an all time historic low and you got to remember they're back there checking every word
the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest rate in 71 years
the unions have worked hard on healthcare and they're going to ruin them
the veteran's unemployment rate drop to the lowest record
the way i look at it when fake news cnn oops there goes the camera off
the whole world
the woman was totally biased
their ratings aren't so good at the academy awards
their ratings would go through the roof but they would rather have a failed broadcast that nobody watches than put on a conservative person and lift the ratings five times
then i got involved and i'll tell you they were happy we got involved
then it was going to 
there's never been this
these are serious fans right
these are the do nothing democrats
these crazy democrats with their hoaxes
these guys are genius
these guys are serious
these people are among the most dishonest human beings on earth
these people are crazy
these people are crazy
these people are sick
they all said that
they are not agents of russia
they beat us on trade and then they win the academy award for a fricking movie
they both got lucky
they both got lucky right
they came and we signed you know who signed me jeff zucker
they can say whatever they want to say
they can take a perfect phone call made to the ukrainian president who said very specifically there was no pressure
they can take nothing
they can't believe we're getting it done
they can't count votes but they're saying they may not be able to do it again
they come over
they come over could be a killer murderer rapist
they couldn't get it done
they didn't get a high school diploma
they didn't know what was happening
they do it all the time
they don't even know their country in many cases
they don't know
they don't think about jobs
they don't think about lowering your drug costs
they don't think about the country
they find a nice deep spot and they dump it
they float it out into the middle of the ocean
they forgot totally
they get nothing done
they go back and they write
they had it look they wanted wanted to show us
they had it the other day
they had no clue
they had problems good problems bad problems families where they don't have the money
they had such a great life before i did this
they had the apprentice on for three hours
they had the money they actually gave the money back but they had no clue
they hate it
they have a big election tomorrow
they just can't count them
they just didn't know how to build it
they kept shooting
they left
they looked for him
they love israel
they never thought i was going to do it but i had no choice
they operate and then they'll give you a bill and you'll say 
they put it number one certainly top five
they put it on a ship
they remove thousands and thousands of ms13 gang members a year and plenty of others
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said boy is a big crowd
they said four more years 12 more years left for them
they said they're trying to start a rumor
they said today that putin wants to be sure that trump gets elected
they say we're getting close
they shipped it overseas and to other countries
they spent $5 billion
they spent 5 billion
they stole our wealth
they take blood
they think it's wonderful
they try they have all these pr things to try and keep their image nice and clean
they used to call it the eighth column
they used to go best foreign movie but now we do it that way
they used to have the eighth column was a big deal right
they used to when we had the late great walter cronkite and these legends right
they want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border and then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare of healthcare of lots of other things including education
they wanted like a couple of hundred million dollars too much
they wanted me to sign for another three years
they went against and i made a terrible mistake
they were nice
they were unbelievable
they work so hard
they wouldn't approve it because they didn't want to be sued
they wouldn't cover it
they'd have a new drug
they'll never know but i hear the same thing could happen tomorrow
they'll say i want to thank and they'll thank hundreds of people but they won't thank you president that i'm the one that pulled it off
they're all on our side by the way
they're all the same
they're exactly the same
they're exactly the same
they're exactly the same
they're going
they're going to buy very large tractors
they're going to say 
they're going to tell you about healthcare
they're going to tell you about our military and the jet fighters and the missiles and rockets but they can't count votes
they're great people
they're in there checking them out
they're killing us on trade
they're mostly out there and i don't want to do that
they're not getting close they'll never know
they're not going to be able to count their vote
they're not good
they're not good at anything else
they're okay
they're really good
they're screamed at
they're still trying to tell us
they're strong tough patriots
they're stupid
they're teamsters so many of the unions
they're the ones and they love it
they're very ruthless people
they're worse than cnn
they're worse than cnn
they've achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded in the history of the united states
they've been incredible fans and they love israel
they've gone crazy
think of it
think of it
think of it
think of it
think of that
think of that
think of the song and you'll remember that usmca is a gigantic victory for farmers ranchers and manufacturers all across the great state of nevada
this could not have been done by anyone but the republican party and ourselves
this day was supposed to be for this evening
this guy this phony is a big environmentalist
this is a big day
this is how evil this is how crazy they are
this is the greatest reality show in history
this is too much fun
this is why in my state of the union address did you like it
this poor guy probably signed a hundred of them and each one's a disaster
this schmuck spends $250 million dollars he ends up with one third of a percent in iowa
this year we had a movie they said best movie they announced the movie from south korea
those are important groups of people
those beautiful kids
those front row people are tough

and i've spent the last four years bringing them back home and we're bringing them back home
and if i did i think i'd be back there
and it's happening
and it's like a perfect poll
and mean questions
and my plan is to arrest them and prosecute them
and next year is going to be one of the greatest years not only for pennsylvania but for the entire country
and no oil no guns no god
and nobody would be talking about this is like the biggest story
and now it's going to be november 3rd and we'll keep it going and we'll get it all like a tree
and now we came out in favor of law enforcement
and now what we're doing is we're holding back funds for cities that don't know what they're doing where they allow crime to run rampant
and our farmers are very unhappy
and she was right for south korea
and so we thought this conor lamb guy he even voted to impeach your president over nothing
and that was an important day and that was an important year 2016
and that's it
and that's very personal
and the boilermakers local union it's local 154 of the boilermakers
and the investment put into pennsylvania the investment put into the commonwealth of pennsylvania has been record setting
and the mayor said 
and then he figures later on he'll go
and then he makes a speech and he always has it not always but a lot of times he has it hanging down
and then yesterday i read that i had strokes
and there could be a day and i'll admit i said 
and they are cop hating
and they have another provision in some states where you can harvest that's where you grab them all together and drop them
and they know i'm in the group with them coming back
and they love our country
and they want to blow mount rushmore
and they were having a big march on washington march elsewhere and amazingly that was the end of the statues coming down
and they're now heading back in that direction quickly
and this is really what's happened
and we had a level of enthusiasm i mean even look today
and we have somebody that blows him away
and we heard that he's going to be for trump but he's going to be fighting for trump
and we love our law enforcement
and we put a 10 year prison sentence at anybody that knocks down a statue
and we're actually prosecuting people for having done it
and we've done the greatest job
and when he decided that i would be the one he got out and there's nobody that's said better things about me
and when it does i hope things work out
and yesterday he took a couple and they were set ups like i've never seen
and you know they'll criticize me for saying this the fake news media which is back there with their fake polls
and you look at the stats and you look at how we've done compared to really much easier and much smaller countries it's amazing
another great friend of mine who's a tough cookie and a great congressman
anybody else's president you wouldn't be talking about vaccines for two or three years from now
anybody ever hear of beaver county
anybody that gets that character
anybody that says they're born for this
anybody up here like to work in ice
are you depressed
as a senator he was weak
as long as you canceled culture you better have a strong president
as soon as i heard she said 
at last year you had the single greatest economic year in the history of your whole operation right
at least you'll spend a couple of nights at that great hospital right
baido is in charge he wants to get rid of everything
baido that's a beauty
because he knew that other countries are ripping us off and so did i
because he was getting killed
because he wasn't a radical left
because i agree with him and he agrees with me on one thing trade
because it's that bad
because look he's got the worst location
because they're fake news
because you know what
because you're going to see some unbelievable price reductions
bernie never dreamt that this was possible crazy bernie
biden has pledged to a point prosecutors who extend these insane far left policies nationwide
biden no that was really great
biden pledged to reinstate it
biden spent the last 47 years betraying the american people
biden supported cutting social security
biden went there today
biden will never be able to protect your jobs or your family
biden would wipe out that entire industry killing the jobs of more than 600000 pennsylvania workers
biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorist
bringing a lot of things back home
burger king
but again you had the greatest year you've ever had last year prior to the virus
but biden replied yes he'll get rid of those jobs
but did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him
but everything he said is right because he has no control over what's happening
but follow that ballot because these people they'll be lost they'll be gone the numbers are incredible where they're 25 and 30% off 20% off
but for the entire summer biden was silent as far left rioters viciously attacked law enforcement in democrat run cities all burned down businesses terrorized civilians and just recently marched through the streets chanting 
but he did say i wasn't perfect but that's okay
but he led his men on a daring mission across the delaware
but he was on the cover of the magazine
but how about this one
but i do these polls
but i go in i come out a couple of hours later i guess whatever it is it's a short time later i get into the car the press sees me get into the car
but i said 
but i took out an old ordinance
but i will keep your jobs in america and i'll bring rioters looters violent extremists anarchists we will bring them to justice
but i will tell you the election that we have coming up is the single most important election in the history of this country
but i'll tell you this man is something special
but if it's not true my wife was like she came to me she said 
but if we have a close election that means nevada has the right to and i love nevada i think we're going to win nevada except where they're sending all these hundreds of thousands millions of unsolicited ballots to people in nevada and people that probably left a long time ago
but if what's going on in the rest of the country is like what's going on in tennessee
but if you look at it the things they've done we're going to go through a couple of different polls as we go along because i love the people saying do this or do that
but if you remember last time i go in i spend a little time a physical like we all have
but in certain ways i like this better
but it is true
but it's okay for them to make every city look just like portland which is a disaster
but nothing happened
but now it's going to go down very big because we did a favorite nation's clause
but one of the things i got you out of is this thing sounds so good but it's so bad
but she made them open and the salon turned her in and the salon did business with her
but she said 
but take a look at what he says about guns and he got put in charge of guns
but take a look at what they say about the way they handled the swine flu
but the anesthesia
but the problem these shutdowns are causing much bigger problems
but the rioters that want biden to win they want him to win because their agenda it's what they want
but the stock market's at record levels
but there's what i think they're doing because you have the same thing in new york
but they fought me on this price transparency
but they knew i'm in the motorcade and yet they reported it anyway because they fake news
but they protected it
but they still go with it they go with it
but they're all voting for me
but they're right behind me
but think of it
but this commonwealth it's a great commonwealth
but this conor lamb was out there fighting it and he shouldn't have done that
but unfortunately he's a former because he's just i don't know
but we could end it in portland
but we did a great job it was an amazing thing
but we had record enthusiasm in 2016
but we had some time
but we will make america wealthy
but you always have to say well wait a minute
but you can't this whole thing with the unsolicited unsolicited means you're sitting there
but you go down the highways and you see it and i was thinking of texas i'm making a speech in front of obviously people that like oil they like god and you know what else they like they like their second amendment right
but you have to make sure your vote counts because the only way they're going to beat us is by doing that kind of stuff
but you're great rick and you did a fantastic job
by the time you get finished the straw is totally disintegrated
by the way as far as the capital of israel jerusalem they've been talking about many many presidents
by the way if it's anything like these other events it could go on forever
by the way just today there's another credible thing happening
by the way the job they do on people that have been just really hurt our heroes
by the way was that greatest evening ever
can we do a poll
can we ever call the commonwealth a state
canceled culture
cases in the us have declined by 28% nationwide over the last month and hospitalizations and deaths have declined radically over the last week
check out all of the statements he's made on everything and now he's going the opposite way but he's agreed to the manifesto entirely so maybe he'll do that
cnn fake news cnn right there
cnn reported i had a heart attack so my wife was concerned
come on
come on
congressman give me your mask
congressman if you have a mini stroke you're not heading back to the white house right
congressman most of the rallies
congressman we were going in the next day
covid-19
covid-19 covid-19
craziness
dan congressman
darling are you okay
death to america
death to america
democrat politicians have failed the black community for decades they've failed the asian community the hispanic community
did anybody read the transcript of that call
did you know kennedy lost in massachusetts
did you know that mike
did you see him on television today
did you see it
did you see that
do it
do we agree
do we like our first lady
do you believe this
do you ever notice he's always calling it the other
do you ever see the companies
do you know crazy bernie
do you know him
do you know why john is the head
do you remember the last days before the campaign
does anybody walk around with a plastic straw
does that make sense
doesn't make any difference
dogs have gotten ballots and they know i'm right and everybody knows i'm right and they say i'm right behind the closed doors and it's a disgrace what they do to our country
don't forget we're energy independent
don't say that try doing it a little softer than that
don't worry about it
duncan congressman duncan right
earlier this year i kept my promise to the commonwealth of pennsylvania when we ended the nafta nightmare and signed the brand new u
either that or people that just don't like our country very much
embassy in jerusalem
especially biden never got it
even as a used ticket you could probably sell
even my own family didn't like me when he got finished
even the new york times gave it good reviews not good reviews beyond good reviews
ever since he made that statement he's looked very bad
every place you've been you've been great
everybody
everybody here going to vote
everybody in the middle east they couldn't believe it
everyone said 
everyone said it will never happen and i had great help from these gentlemen right here
except there was one there was a group of great italians in new york they tried to take down
except these young ones
except when he got to washington he voted with pelosi a hundred percent of the time
follow your ballot
for political reasons they'll be open
for us we got nothing
for years you had a president who apologized for america
fracking's okay
france is having a big blow up
fred keller fred thank you
from kentucky
from now on when i go for a physical or something or go to the hospital announce it because this was a quick thing
from your standpoint it's very close to the election
george washington
george washington can you believe
george washington they want the name off
get off that plane
glenn thompson

good luck
good thing to have i guess as long as they give you a good answer
got to do it again
great job fred
great job great job glenn really great
great job you're doing
great thank you john
guy reschenthaler
guy reschenthaler
hanging down
hanging down
has anybody ever tried seriously the new straw it's made out of paper right
has anybody ever tried those paper straws
have to do it again
have to do it again
he actually brought it further left
he agreed to all this stuff
he always starts off covid-19
he calls it the opposite
he could have put those people in the convention center in the hospital ship
he did it a little bit softer but we were right
he didn't get it in prime time
he gave $1
he gets it mixed up
he had a lot of mask on i'll tell you that
he has no clue where he is but he keeps saying 
he is a puppet of the socialists marxists and the cop hating extremists
he made a horrible mistake and i built him a convention center with 2800 beds and they didn't use it and i sent up a ship a great hospital ship a massive hospital with hundreds and hundreds of rooms and they didn't use it and he requested it and then i said 
he never got it
he opposed the killing of soleimani when i did that he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said it was horrible
he said they got lucky
he said they're coming people that never really cared to vote they're great americans but they never wanted to vote for the people that they were seeing
he said we did a horrible job
he supported the korean deal the korean deal was so bad it was so bad
he voted for the iraq war he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden
he voted with craziness
he wants to surrender your nation to the radical left wing mob
he was a little late
he was always for things that you wouldn't want and now he's changing 
he was born for it
he was like a semi-normal person just slightly left
he was not known as being one of the smart ones and now it's not exactly primetime i can tell you that
he was on the cover of a magazine i won't mention the magazine they're back there
he was the governor of texas for what
he was weak
he'll get us in wars
he's a congressman who have really been warriors for me
he's a great doctor
he's a real hero a real tough guy and he'll never let you down sean parnell
he's great
he's in big trouble i'll tell you
he's just a special guy and really has a big beautiful heart lou barletta lou
he's like a lamb
he's more of a hero he's tougher he's stronger he's smarter he's better looking not that that matters
he's not too happy her opponent
he's trying to change now
here take it blah blah blah
heroes of our country
hey boilermakers thank you
hey congratulations
hey it happens all of us
hey listen we ended that problem
hey rick how are we doing in texas
hi hi hi hi
hillary
hillary came in second in utah
his son walked out with a lot of money for doing nothing
hopefully you have them
how about guns
how about that
how could that be
how did you guys allow that to happen
how did you know that congressmen
how do you like
how do you like that
how do you like the idea of taking down our statues to our great george washington thomas jefferson abraham lincoln andrew jackson all of them
how much do they hate nancy pelosi
huh
huh
i actually thought that was the crowd
i agree with you
i am standing between them and your second amendment
i can look at that guy and he'll catch it
i could read numbers that would be even much better because a big percentage of the people that died in this country died because new york was incompetently run by mayor de blasio and governor cuomo
i decided not to see china because i didn't like the way they were doing business okay
i did it
i don't care about biden
i don't care about this guy
i don't have to travel
i don't know
i don't know what a mini stroke is but it's not good
i don't know what it is the relationship we have with all of us with all of us
i don't know what's happening in pennsylvania
i don't know what's happening in the rest of the country
i don't talk about looks
i don't think george washington running with abraham lincoln as his vp he'll pick abraham lincoln as vp is going to win in texas or in pennsylvania or any place else with those three things eliminated
i don't think i would have turned her in
i don't think so
i don't think the boiler makers
i don't think the public is going to fall for it
i don't think we have too many farmers in this wonderful pennsylvania town
i don't want to get into a situation like where biden used a record player
i don't want to touch your damn mask
i don't want to vote
i ended the last administration's eight year pure war on pennsylvania oil and coal and fracking
i even reduced in germany because germany they're an ally but you know they took advantage of us very badly on trade and very badly with our military
i gave a new executive order
i get off the plane
i get the hell out of here
i go 
i got to take care of my customers right
i guess under anesthesia
i had a little pause today
i had a lot of his voters come to me four years ago a big percentage
i have all
i haven't been keeping up with it
i instituted a favorite so we're paying $2
i just like to ask you i'm sorry to bother you with this question
i just opened it up and i said 
i just put out that if she was set up then she shouldn't be leading the house of representatives
i just want to announce tonight because we're joined with some very very special warriors and dan meuser dan thank you very much
i kept my promise recognized the true capital of israel
i kept us out of wars what happened with north korea
i know we have a lot of boilermakers over there
i made a mistake sorry
i made you famous today
i make a speech
i mean it's an airport
i mean literally there we landed
i mean the congressional race which they just gave up and they declared her a winner which they should not have done they should make that a do-over and i think in paterson they have a do-over
i mean they said that they'd never seen anything like it
i never said
i never said about fracking
i never said that
i never said that
i promise you this
i really believe they don't love our country
i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said i'd better win this election
i said thank you anyway
i said to my people at the end of the day what is price transparency
i saved myself so much money
i saw some of his commercials i thought he was a republican right
i say 
i say 
i say 
i see rick perry right there
i see the drug companies are they're killing me with ads
i tell you
i tell you what our vice-president mike pence and the task force headed up by mike and working along with a lot of great people they've done a fantastic job and they just get no credit
i think both highly qualified judges from what i understand i hear that they're not too happy about what they're seeing
i think i would have known that
i think i've answered more questions from these maniacs than any president in history
i think it's a good thing
i think it's an important thing
i think they're going to do it over because it was just ripe with fraud theft
i think we're way ahead of what we were four years ago and there's far more enthusiasm
i think you're great
i think you're great
i took it out
i took out an old ordinance a very old one because today in congress you don't get things like that today
i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's pillaging plundering and rampant theft of pennsylvania and many other places jobs
i want to have it hanging from my ear
i want to see the results of the election on november 3
i want you to look in my eyes
i was actually disappointed to be honest
i was born
i was born for this
i was born to run for president
i was going to say 
i was set up
i was set up
i was set up by the salon owner
i was the only one that wanted to do it actually
i was there probably for an hour and a half two hours
i was waving at them
i was way ahead
i wasn't waving at you
i watched biden yesterday so he hasn't answered questions in what two months or something
i watched nancy pelosi
i went to see them two days ago
i withdrew from that calamity
i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal think of this
i wonder how that happened
i wonder what that's all about
i would've said 
i wouldn't have needed a rally
i'd do a lot of them a day
i'd say 
i'll be home in 15 minutes darling
i'll tell you
i'll tell you
i'll tell you right now
i'll tell you we could end it in portland in a half an hour
i'll tell you what
i'm a democrat
i'm in the same motorcade i go in and i go out
i'm landing
i'm looking in the front row
i'm not in love with the idea
i'm telling you wouldn't have believed it
i'm thrilled to be in latrobe the home of the late great my friend arnold palmer
i'm trying to be nice
i'm trying to be nice
i've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the african-american community and for all communities and the best is yet to come
ice and border patrol
ice and border patrol
if i get along with russia is that a good thing or a bad thing
if i was a democrat a different president and they did the same job they'd say it was one of the greatest jobs they've ever seen
if i were a psychiatrist right
if i weren't president you would either have an obliterated second amendment or it would be gone entirely
if they didn't waste a year and a half of my life on a ridiculous impeachment based on a phone call that was perfect this stuff would have all been done
if they give you a bad answer don't bother possibly too late
if we had honest press it would be so great for the usa
if we had listened to sleepy joe hundreds of thousands of more americans would have died
if you don't do fracking in pennsylvania 900000 jobs and your energy bills will triple
if you look at some of our numbers
if you look at the natural gas what they've done to this state what they were doing to this state
if you look now spain is having a big blow up
if you took new york out of it which was a disaster by cuomo if you took new york out of those numbers we would have numbers that would be even better than they are
if you would see how beautiful if you would see how beautiful this is it was like this perfect evening the sun was setting the faces of these great great majestic heroes of our country right
if you're not a radical lefty meaning guns meaning fossil fuels they want wind wind
in all fairness we have some countries that have treated us very well and we're going to take care of those countries but we are energy independent for the first time and that's a very good feeling
in his best days 25 30 years ago he was weak
in his manifesto with bernie sanders that's what it is biden agreed to all these things
in nevada they actually have a provision where they don't have to be counted until seven days after the election
in the hopefully rounding the turn on the pandemic we're rounding that turn and vaccines are coming along great
in the old days they called it anesthesia
incredible
is this one a commonwealth
it disintegrates as you drink and if you have a nice tie like this tie this would have no chance
it ended
it gives him a feeling of security
it has to be opened up now
it lasted for a little while no matter what i did
it produced 250000 jobs
it says 10 years in prison
it takes a little while to plant your tax cuts
it took a while for the governor
it was a disaster
it was a little different plane
it was a perfect call
it was a terrible deal i renegotiated now it's a good deal
it was a totally lopsided 100% political witch hunt and it goes on and on
it was an original statement that a lot of people picked up but it's so true
it was black and white instead of the blue and white
it was called swine flu
it was incompetent
it was like a perfect call
it was sort of easy
it will always protect patients with preexisting conditions always
it would be so great
it would have all been done
it'll be delivered before in my opinion before the end of the year but it really might even be delivered before the end of october
it'll be nice because we want to save people
it'll be over
it's a big step for the middle east
it's a deal with israel and the uae and that's going to lead and i'm going to tell you we have representatives over right now and other people are saying we want to get in that deal
it's a death sentence for your energy jobs
it's a disaster a death sentence
it's a disgrace
it's a disgrace
it's a disgrace and they ought to get together
it's a great honor to have you
it's a great place
it's a hard business
it's a little tough
it's a lot it's like the size of this right
it's a place i know very well
it's a rip off of our country
it's a shame what they're doing
it's a super v and you'll see that and big numbers are coming out and have come out and just watch your set or watch your newspaper
it's a total phony magazine
it's a tough one because it's so contagious
it's a way of really taking advantage of the united states
it's actually happening in a super v not a v
it's all done
it's always nice
it's always nice
it's been the commonwealth's greatest
it's bigger than healthcare could be bigger than healthcare
it's called price transparency
it's essentially the same thing
it's going to cost you billions and billions of dollars
it's happening
it's happening very fast
it's incredible
it's just the craziest thing
it's like i made the statement it's like building a car but more sophisticated
it's like otherwise we have to do something much bigger and it's totally unnecessary
it's like the plane times 50
it's much easier than the way they have to go about it right
it's never going to happen to them
it's new and it's beautiful and i told you we took over 100% of the isis caliphate in iraq and syria and we killed the founder and leader of isis al-baghdadi and separately we killed the world's number one terrorist number one terrorist for decades and decades qasem soleimani
it's not contagious like this
it's not like the restaurants is the greatest business in the world
it's probably 940000 they say
it's real easy
it's really unfair because our people have enthusiasm they're going out to vote
it's stronger
it's terrible but we have ended it
it's the craziest thing i've ever seen
it's the green new deal right
it's the most incredible
it's very far if you have a restaurant and you can't open your restaurant
it's very unfair it's very unfair but think of it
it's where the army weathered its brutal winter at valley forge and where general george washington who by the way they want all of the name washington removed from everything
it's worse
january 1st
job numbers retail sale numbers they're all at records
joe biden got the worst marks you've ever seen for his handling of the h1ni swine flu
joe biden spent the last 47 years shipping pennsylvania jobs to china and foreign nations
joe biden supported nafta china's entry into the world trade
joe biden wants to surrender your jobs to china
joe biden's agenda is made in china my agenda is made in america
joe look
john we appreciate it
just in closing we will rapidly return to full employment soaring wages and record prosperity
just remember that conor lamb and i remember because he's like a lamb he's like a little lamb
just take a look because we i said to my people 
last year i visited the shell petrochemical plant in beaver county
let me just say she is a highly overrated person
let me just tell you something
let me not even talk to the congressmen

nobody that needed a ventilator didn't get a ventilator
none of you were around to see it and it now represents members in pennsylvania ohio and west virginia
north carolina's closed
not all of them
not because of the electric
not that it matters i guess
november
now biden today came out and said 
now but for another president especially in the last administration they had the h1n1 pandemic
now for the same visit that was the stupidest thing
now he really doesn't get it
now he really gets nothing
now he's coming and saying 
now i had to go back to work and we've done a great job on it

she should have said 
she sounded relieved
she uses the salon and the salon turned her in
she's not got much going
sign your mail-in ballot
since then he's cratered
sir we have it all set
sir would you like to go over and do a physical
sir would you like to go over and do your physical or do a piece of it or finish it
sir would you like to go over to walter reed
six cars in front of the press because they have a big car
so anyway these are really dangerous people
so i go in and that rumor lasted for a little while like a day or two
so i guess biden pretty soon he's going to be coming out saying 
so i said 
so i went in i did that part of the physical
so joe hiden we have a new one joe hiden
so mike and i listened and we said

so the cars are driving all over to about a 20 minute drive and we get to the hospital i get out
so the doctor white house doctor highly respected sean sean conley 
so the doctor wrote a letter saying 
so they know i got in and cnn reported that i had a heart attack

so we went we went and we're driving
so we'll see what happens
so what's going to happen that'll go up
so whether it's pennsylvania or texas or oklahoma or north dakota or any place you take a look at this right
solicited is okay because that's when you're asking and you want it and you send in the necessary paperwork and documentation and you get the ballot and you fill it out that's okay
some deal oh it was china

the largest investment in your state's history all made possible by our pro-energy policies
the lawyers feel very confident but we have to win those cases but what you have to do is send in your early ballot and then go and make sure that ballot is tabulated or counted and if it's not counted vote and then they have the job if it comes in late and if it's not too late they have the job of making sure that they don't count it

and above all we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one america
and actually before we won they were plotting to overthrow this election
and agriculture commissioner ryan quarles
and by the way that's not rich that's not poor that's for everybody
and don't forget
and don't forget right to try by the way where somebody who's terminally ill can now use our medicines which they were never allowed to in the past
and don't forget that was zero interest
and from an incredible state that we won 2016 that crooked hillary said she's going to win that state didn't come too close at winning that state
and governor matt bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children and there is no better leader than him what he has done
and he said this 
and he straightened it out
and he'll vote his own way
and he's done a fantastic job
and he's done unbelievably well
and how about saying by the way mr
and i give them a lot of credit by the way i give china
and i got to be honest with you i've never seen so many people vote
and i recognize israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
and i said congratulations farmers
and i said when it came time to picking the republican party chair head of the rnc i said i got to get the woman from michigan ronna mcdaniel to head it up
and i think i'm going to count but i think it's like 118
and i think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot
and i think we won them because of the second amendment because it's under assault from democrats
and i thought they'd say none or one or two
and i want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives and the job that matt bevin has done as governor he's had to do some things that you had to do
and i want to thank mexico
and i'll tell you he's a little bit different
and i'll tell you they started buying our farm product
and i'll tell you what he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state
and i'm telling other countries i'm sorry you're going to have to pay now
and if i would have ever said that during the campaign the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it
and if you lose they're going to say trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world
and in the whole world even on a monday night i like the monday nights because i think we're 58 and 0 that's a good record
and it won't be long
and it's up to pelosi who has to put it forward but she's too busy wasting their time
and ladies and gentlemen of kentucky the best is yet to come
and mr
and mr
and nancy unlike kentucky which is doing great nancy ought stop wasting time go back to her district in san francisco help the homeless get rid of the drugs get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system
and now he's got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country including george washington and abraham lincoln
and now they're a little different a little different
and our country is winning again and our country is highly respected again
and our devotion is to our creator
and our numbers are looking very good
and she's wasting all of her time
and that includes the gentleman that's running against matt
and that was going to happen here
and that's what happened
and that's what it was it was a mob
and that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
and the democrats have never witnessed anything like it and they know they're not going to win in 2020
and the job he's done one of the best in the country
and the man that took his place is dead also
and the other three couldn't get there because of but they were votes
and the year before i got them $12 billion
and then bill clinton actually told hillary clinton 
and then he goes 
and then i actually wanted to release the actual conversation
and then mr
and then one by one we were doing good
and these are people they love our country they're incredible they work hard but they never liked what they were voting for so they really wouldn't vote
and they do
and they have no idea because when we do hang it up they're all out of business
and they poured precious american blood and treasure into the middle east while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair
and they say 
and they totally lost respect for let's say the husband totally lost respect
and they're all bad
and today just today a record 158 million americans are now employed the highest level of employment in our country's history
and together we're fighting for american orphans foster families and the sacred rights of religious believers
and two republicans think of that
and we are having unbelievable success
and we are really really advanced
and we ended the war on beautiful clean coal
and we need so badly
and we will also protect you with preexisting physicians
and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
and we will make america great again
and we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the united states supreme court ruled it totally constitutional
and we won the great state of michigan for the first time in many years
and we'll have a great speaker of the house in kevin
and we're bringing 5g into places like kentucky that haven't been properly served
and we're more determined than ever to drain the swamp and that's what we're doing with these crazy people
and we're really ahead of schedule
and we're sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country to the rest of the world that the republican party you know what we stand for
and what we've done if you remember before we ran companies were leaving kentucky they were leaving they will go into mexico
and with the help of your senate majority leader mitch mcconnell we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written
and yet we're investing billions and billions of dollars in places you've never even heard of
and you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that have you
and you know all of these crazy like cnn with its bad ratings there goes its red light it just went off
and you know how i know
and you know what
and you know what if the democrats get in that's not going down by 50% that's going down to nothing
and you know what it's backfiring
and you see what's happening
and your next attorney general daniel cameron
andy barr is here with us tonight and we're going to introduce him but he beat her
another warrior
any place but kentucky
anybody in here a person of faith
are you sure we need an election tomorrow matt
as sure as you're standing here is anybody sitting
ask them how they're doing in paris with it
auditor mark harmon
be gentle be gentle
be very gentle
be very gentle
because again your state is setting records
because andy barr had amy mcgrath an extreme liberal against him
because i've been saying it for two years and they never corrected me
because if you lose it sends a really bad message
because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities really bad
because the bidens got rich while america was robbed and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in
because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks you're going to find out
because they consider it to be a front page story
because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down but they don't say the second part
because under their plan you don't get your own doctor
because we're doing very well right now with china
because you know with the fake news if i'm off by half a point
before my election our leaders used the great american middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects
before we won
beshear doesn't represent you
beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of donald trump
beshear is too liberal too extreme and too dangerous for the state of kentucky
beshear supported crooked hillary clinton and he's funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics
beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to kentucky think of that one
biden solely answer
billions of dollars
brett guthrie
but after years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation
but beshear wants to shut down your coal shut down your energy raise your taxes and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of kentucky
but go back to nancy's area look at what's happened
but he said about sleepy joe about china 
but he was in iowa yesterday
but hopefully we don't have to even think about it
but i had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had
but i like this one very much and we're going to help him
but i looked at the new york times and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store right
but i think we won also because of sanctuary cities
but isn't that really what you wanted in a governor
but jill stein was an agent of russia also
but like a lot over 100 where we had the highest stock market in our history
but matt bevin has made record investments in education spending for kentucky students
but matt's running against these people and we have to send them a sign because they're dangerous
but now we're taking in tens of billions and billions and billions of dollars
but that disgusting newspaper that's right there the washington post declared the campaign to impeach president trump has just begun
but that was with zero interest real easy with zero interest
but the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt
but the sellout of the american nation ended the day i took the oath of office and you understand that
but then we had the democrats
but these are also great fighters great warriors
but these are very dishonest people shifty schiff
but they all had one thing in common
but they didn't like anything that they saw
but they'll be endorsing us
but think of it we're one day short of a year now
but under this administration the great betrayal is over
but we built it up
but we didn't fight them over there only to invite them over here
but we're going to get back to that later
but we've created 6
but whenever i've needed him whenever i needed him he was always there
but whenever we need and i'm not talking about me i'm talking about we we need a vote he's so incredible and he's become a really good friend
but while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the radical democrats are going totally insane
but you see what's happening with the democrats they have gone crazy
but you were very much underserved for years
but you're going to have a great victory tomorrow
by the way do we love our law enforcement
by the way people can't even believe it
by the way the other governor
by the way they play at a very big arena
by the way you're going to lose your second amendment if you vote in democrats
campaign manager
can you believe it
can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations
can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made
china
china wants to make a deal so badly
china's doing poorly as you know but they're paying us billions and billions and billions of dollars and they've never given us 25 cents before
come out from the valleys come out from the mountains come out from areas that they've never come out
congratulations on your economy
congressman mark meadows
could you call the head of some company in japan please
could you come again
could you come make another speech please
could you do it again
could you imagine if don jr
could you imagine if i did what he did
countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldn't even believe it's possible and we have a travel ban now
dammit he should have left sooner we told him
democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day
democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith
democrats need to pass the us mca
democrats want open borders
did you ever see that movie a star is born
did you put a comma in the wrong location sir
do you remember last year
do you think the press would be saying well it's unsubstantiated
doesn't make sense does it
doing a great job
education is so important to him
even for the wildcats that's a good
everybody has good jobs
extreme liberal anti-gun lots of different things
fake news media
first democrats engineer the russia hoax the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the american people the russian hoax
first time i've ever said that just thought of that
for the sake of our freedom for the sake of our children we are going to keep on working
for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
foreign leaders come in to see me 
frankly honestly they want to make a deal a lot more than i want to make a deal
from an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left
get off get off

he hasn't learned what's happened
he is on tape doing a real quid pro quo
he loves his state
he made a horrible statement
he makes up a conversation
he put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he's done is incredible
he repeats my conversation with the head of the ukraine the new president a good guy repeats it
he represents the washington swamp and he's backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election
he said 
he said 
he said 
he used to say 
he wants sanctuary cities
he wants to take charge in control of our country
he works smart
he wouldn't apologize to you but he apologized to others
he'd go around oh thank you so much
he'll be calling for a meeting and i won't be able to see him because i don't like him very much
he'll make millions and millions with that
he's a great natural talent in business which you needed
he's a patriot
he's a warrior
he's a warrior i've always said it
he's been a very very successful business leader
he's been incredible
he's been up there long enough
he's done a fantastic job
he's done a fantastic job
he's done it all
he's going home to mom
he's going to win
he's got that little libertarian touch
he's never going to leave office
he's not going to do so well
he's pro-worker pro-life and 100% pro-second amendment
he's such a pain in the ass but that's what you want

how about this guy
how many do we have
how many what sir
how the hell can you lose 60000
i always say because they're lousy politicians they've got lousy policy but they do stick together
i announced the withdrawal of the united states from the horrible costly one-sided paris climate accord
i call it the failing new york times only because eventually it will fail
i came in and i said 
i came into my office they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made
i can't believe it
i can't even imagine how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left
i can't speak for the rest of the country but if the rest of the countries like tennessee you're going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation
i canceled the so called clean power plan and repealed obama's federal coal moratorium
i defeated isis
i didn't even know to what extent
i don't care
i don't even want to tell you
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know jill stein
i don't know tulsi gabbard but hillary clinton said that tulsi gabbard is a russian agent
i don't need you to vote rand
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't want to get sued
i don't want to know everything
i get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign 
i got to leave
i got to tell you i've been negotiating with china
i got you choice too
i have to say you know maybe because of the election but it's okay
i just saw kellyanne
i just took them out of the tariffs and we had a lot leftover
i know a lot of people that work hard
i love being in ohio
i love our farmers
i love you
i mean i can't blame them
i mean sometimes like i'd say 
i mean when i said let's do this i said to our great now first lady
i never said that
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said congratulations
i said stand up
i said you can't do that
i say 
i see what they're saying
i shouldn't say it
i think they'd love to see another president
i thought that was a typo
i thought that was another typo
i told you we have a record stock market today
i want to bring up a man and i'm serious about this
i want to have him come up for a second
i was a very good student
i was elected to be president of the united states not president of the globe
i was watching the other night the great lou dobbs and he said 
i watch what they're doing
i watched him today he used the word folks
i watched the last debate and this weakling named anderson cooper saying well it's totally unsubstantiated mr
i will always protect medicare for our nation's seniors
i will tell you nobody works harder and frankly maybe more importantly nobody works smarter
i withdrew our nation from the horrible one sided iran nuclear deal
i'm a very like we're all smart
i'm going to become a politician
i'm going to become a politician
i'm here because of them
i'm sorry
i'm sorry
i've never seen anything like it
if it's 117 and not 118 even if i go under they report it
if you don't like your job you find another one
if you lost 500 million that's a lot
if you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities you have only one choice tomorrow and that's to vote for matt bevin
if you win they're going to make it like ho hum
impeachment
in fact i love dogs but they gave the dog full credit
in fact i'm here because of them when you think about it
in other words people are now getting interest in their money
in the face of these attacks republicans are the most unified that i've ever seen and i've been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time
in the history of your state you've never done this well economically job wise unemployment employment factories moving in new factories open expansion of your car plants
in the past administration toward the end we had certain things that we could have done
in the republican party we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount
in their craze thirst for power the democrats are trying to tear our country apart
including the supreme court obviously
is that what you want
isn't that exciting
isn't that terrible
it begins november 3rd this time
it just sends a bad and they will build it up
it sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future
it takes a lot
it turned out to be right
it was a total lie
it was an assault
it was dead
it was really 119
it would take us 15 minutes and we could end the loopholes
it'll go very quickly
it's a great state and we love the people of north carolina
it's going to be protected
it's going to be worthless
it's going to be worthless
it's going up rapidly
it's got a big impact
it's great
it's great to be here in the home of a group called the wildcats
it's incredible what they're doing
it's like the choice i got from military
it's moving along rapidly
it's not going to happen folks because we can't let our country go back to hell
it's not going to work that way
it's not me it's we
it's not the same country
it's not what you want
it's okay
it's really let it be a bipartisan deal
it's so important
it's so important
it's such an incredible deal for this country and nafta was one of the worst deals ever made
it's the fake news
it's true
it's true
it's true two years
it's up here
james comer

mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass va choice and va accountability for our amazing veterans
mr
mueller testified
my administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries
my first week in office i canceled that job-killing travesty

nobody works harder for kentucky than mitch
nobody would have thought that was possible
not 500 million

not too good
nothing can
now corrupt politicians nancy pelosi and adam schiff they are corrupt
now he is difficult
now i know mitch's opponent because they came here
now look $1

now that's hundreds of days
now they think he's a financial genius because he's up 74%
now they're all coming back
now they're saying see i told you he was a dictator
now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of kentucky
oh great doc fix me up doc
okay
on no issue have democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration
on trade we're starting to set records every week we're reversing decades of washington disloyalty stupidity and corruption
only in kentucky can somebody be so precise
open borders let everyone pour right in
or eric trump walked out of china while i was let's say vice president or president
otherwise you can't pass it
our allegiance is to our nation
our loyalty is to our citizens
out of 194 we got 194 not one republican left us last week
past administrations did nothing as china looted our factories and stole up to $500 billion of american dollars
past leaders transform far away nations into chaotic war zones
pay

pay you got to pay
people tell me that their wives their husbands all of a sudden they've been running the 401s for years
people will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out but we're doing very well

preexisting physicians
president i hope you can tell that kentucky is trump country
president i make a personal commitment to you as the next attorney general we are going to make sure that kentucky is never a sanctuary state
president we are going to stand with you in protecting the second amendment rights of all kentuckians
president would you please take over the negotiations that president trump is no longer handling
pretty good
pretty good right
ralph alvarado
rand paul your senator a great warrior
releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent kentucky families
remember
remember years ago before i ever thought of doing this
reminded me by the way of your governor from the standpoint she never quit
right
right to try
see how it is
see now they're going crazy
she called 
she compared it to 9/11 a slander upon our nation
she has really fantastic geniuses
she says darling i love you
she supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody
she wanted to go to the house now she wants to go
she wants open borders
she wants to get rid of it
she was caught telling donors democrats that she is further left than anyone in the history of the state of kentucky
she wasn't too happy with me last year
she's a greenie and that's fine
she's a greenie jill stein
she's doing great

so either pass it or go back to san francisco and clean up your mess
so i can just see these handlers because they're handlers like they use on horses they're handlers right
so i just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do
so instead of traveling to asia and europe and all over the world or going home hopeless and dying they can now use what we call right to try
so last week think of this in the history of our country it's never done better
so let's see what can we do to win but that's not working too well
so many things
so mitch and i and rand would like to thank very much president obama because nobody ever been so generous in their life
so next november the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed kentucky conservative mitch mcconnell
so president obama left mitch and me and rand and all of us he left 142 openings for judges
so she said to herself 
so they're screaming 
so today we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market
so tomorrow we need you to go out and get your friends get your family get your neighbors
so we're also joined tonight by a very powerful man in washington your great senator mitch mcconnell
some of whom are here tonight

thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our southern border illegal crossings have dropped 60% since may
that is not the same group of chinese people that i've been negotiating with
that was a great statement
that was a great statement from people from a great state also
that was a wonderful day for me
that would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible governor
that would have been one of the great catastrophes
that's a lot
that's about it
that's compliments of china
that's good
that's incredible
that's not bad

that's the way it is
that's unusual
that's what you get
that's what you want
that's who they want to win
that's why they did they targeted our farmers
that's why we ended the paris accord
the american people are fed up with democrat lies hoaxes slander
the best employment numbers we have the best of everything
the democrat's planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate medicare
the democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon
the do nothing democrats and they're not getting it done
the dog got the credit and the dog will be coming very shortly by the way to the white house
the far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation telling you what to think what to believe and how you should live
the great state of kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth
the greatest economy you've ever had he's going to destroy it
the history of our country
the incredible rebuilding of our military includes over $100 billion investments all across the state of kentucky
the last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs
the money we spend on other country's militaries but it's coming down
the monsters animal known as al-baghdadi is dead
the mueller scam
the next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you
the obama biden's administration's trans-pacific partnership would have dealt the death blow to the american auto industry
the polls say everything's good
the radical left named andy beshear who rejects everything kentucky stands for
the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and it's the party of the great abraham lincoln
the second amendment very very important very precious
the wall is being built
the wind would blow it away
their red light just went off
their red light just went off
then he said 
then he said 
then they demanded that america accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions
then they did the mueller scam
there has never been a man treated so badly in washington as judge kavanaugh previously judge now justice
there's been no place in the country that's gone down like the area that nancy pelosi represents
these are bad people
these people are crazy
these people are crazy
these people are crazy said
these people are lunatics
these people are on the run and i will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand
these people not all of them but these people are very dishonest people
these proud kentucky patriots did not shed their blood sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage
these tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a home
they are after your second amendment
they believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world
they came from the valleys they came from everywhere the cities they came from places they're still trying to figure out 
they can now go and try
they can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world and they make it look as bad as possible
they decimated american manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries
they deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations subsidizing their welfare states with your money
they didn't do anything
they didn't do anything but we did
they didn't give me any credit
they didn't have a lot of luxury
they didn't have a lot of money
they don't want to end the loophole
they gave a lot of that money to our farmers who got targeted but no longer
they gave him 1
they have it on their covering and now they know they're ready to get hit so they turn it off
they know that
they love me
they love their families they love their country and they love their god
they said 
they said 
they said they were totally votes had airport problems
they say 
they say he didn't tell the truth
they say he hurt my arm
they say trump only got one standing ovation
they should have never let it happen
they started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done
they try and convince you it's good
they want to erase our traditions our culture our history and our heroes
they want to give illegal aliens free healthcare free education more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets
they want to indoctrinate your children you know this destroy anyone who calls traditional america american values
they want to make a deal so badly
they want to obliterate the rule of law drive out faith from the public square and you know this silence you online confiscate your guns
they want to subjugate you and break you to their will but kentucky will never be broken
they were globalists

they're after your second amendment
they're all coming back
they're back buying from our farmers
they're calling me all the time

when the democrat arsonists in washington tried to destroy an innocent man named brett kavanaugh now justice brett kavanaugh mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob

45 minutes
45 minutes
5 million people have joined the workforce and nobody believed that was possible
a few days ago
a friend of mine a world champion
a great guy
a long time ago
a lot of ships a lot of humvees
a man who has become a great friend of mine he's a warrior
a trillion
a trillion not a billion
a woman can win for president
a woman can't win
according to elizabeth pocahontas warren who has somewhat less indian blood in her than i do and i have none
african american hispanic american asian american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country
african american youth the way it was was so high was so horrible
african-american poverty has reached the lowest rate ever recorded also
after authorities released him he committed violent battery only to be released one more time
all of a sudden they said 
all right
allowed to go from your sanctuary city
america is respected again
america is thriving like never before and ladies and gentlemen of wisconsin the best is yet to come
and a good friend of all of ours a kenosha native reince priebus
and above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america
and all of a sudden she hit 8 million
and all of a sudden they see these beautiful very expensive i will tell you brand new apache helicopters roaming over the top
and america is thriving again like never before
and an hour later or so we get a call back
and by the way that's because we got a lot of help from a guy named scott walker
and by the way they think they caught me
and clearly the fakers back there nobody thought that was possible
and for decades politicians ran for office promising to defend wisconsin workers but then they went to washington and lined their pockets with special interest cash as they shipped your jobs and your dreams to countries thousands of miles away
and frankly they already started the attack as you saw in baghdad on our very large embassy in baghdad
and from west bend to west dallas we stand on the shoulders of the most courageous men and women ever to walk on the face of the earth
and he does it every time
and he was there with the head of hezbollah and they were talking about like hillary clinton
and here's another one
and here's the thing
and honduras and guatemala which they get that we're not taking them back but with us they take them back
and i made one big mistake
and i said man they are quick
and i said they just saved themselves a trillion dollars and a lot of lives
and i said to our generals 
and i was more interested in the orange than i was in the cost
and i will tell you when we took over a little less than three years ago isis was all over the place
and i'm thrilled to be back in wisconsin where we had a very big night a few years ago
and i'm thrilled tonight
and if i get a couple of additional pipelines approved which i will very quickly instead of waiting 20 years to get them approved it'll increase this by another 22% that will get them done quickly
and if our opponents had won the election instead of going up we're very close to 30000 on the dow
and in 10 years from now when i run yet again she'll be voting for trump too
and in your great state of iowa iowa
and is there ever ever a better place to be than a trump rally on some night during some week
and it became harvard university for terrorists right
and it was a beautiful sight
and it was just announced from south korea makes a lot of our products unfortunately i put a tariff on washing machines and refrigerators right
and it's already having a tremendous impact on people not being able to come into our country
and just one final thing
and last year our great american warriors because that's what they are
and now the last one is we're working on cars
and our last election was so important
and ron johnson helped and tim scott of south carolina helped right
and see benghazi they didn't respond
and she said it has to be clear cut
and since then we've produced everything we said and more and more
and so we did what we did right
and that was precision
and that's okay because you know right
and the fake news they give him a total pass and that's okay
and the iranians thousands and thousands of iranians were supposed to walk on it and trample it and step and beat the hell out of it
and the new bulb i don't know if you see it it's on there
and then dung dung
and then in california this governor who has no clue by the way he has no clue
and then our opponents say 
and then they say somebody's going to come and say well we'll do a better job
and then they see our great military
and then they went out and mortgaged the hell out of the place and they ended up losing it to the banks
and then ultimately it was with isis
and these guys were better than tom cruise at his best
and they love it
and they said it's our turn now
and they'll be environmentally friendly and all of that
and they'll interview 203 people
and this guy did kill
and to give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed
and under my administration we now have the lowest average unemployment rate of any administration in the history of our country
and walls do work
and we also got rid of remnants of isis
and we get along with turkey
and we live by the words of our national motto 
and we may get that all taken care of this week or next week
and we saw those missiles launched and they were big and they were fast and they were accurate
and we should be up to over 400 miles by next year the end of next year and shortly thereafter it'll be finished
and we were ready
and we will soon be replacing the nafta catastrophe one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world frankly with the incredible us mca canada mexico a giant victory for wisconsin workers farmers and dairy producers a tremendous victory
and we're getting a lot of good response
and we're going to keep the white house but we're going to win back the house
and what we've just done for the people of california is we've made it possible on a federal basis that they don't have to divert all that water anymore
and you have a great quarterback who's a good guy a good guy
and you know what
and you're great green bay packers are playing san francisco this weekend
and you're very tough people
anything we do they go the opposite
are you having a good time sir
as usual they don't do anything
as we begin the year our economy is booming wages are rising poverty is plummeting
at my direction the united states military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist number one terrorist
at stake in our present battle is the survival of the nation
bad people
bad people
because i don't know if you know it
because i guarantee you that mom voted for trump
because i'm always surprised
because i'm pro-trump
because mexico's paying for the wall
because the taxes are too high
because they don't want to pay the 25% tariff
because they keep saying oh the rich are getting richer
because this didn't happen so quickly
because what i did is i took our soldiers and you know what i did
because working together we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america proud again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again
been a long time
been a long time
been a long time
before it was talk
bernie
bernie and the radical left cannot protect your family and they cannot protect our country nor do they want to i think
bernie is surging
better light for much less money if you want it right
bush couldn't do it
but 12 of them hit
but bernie said according to her bernie said and i don't believe that he said this because i don't know him
but crazy bernie sanders and the washington democrats by the way bernie is surging
but do you remember
but ending catch and release was a very big thing and we did that with no democrat help
but even president obama's own former national security advisor a highly respected general named jim jones praised our action to take out soleimani and said it was absolutely correct and it was the absolute right thing to do
but he did kill terrorists right
but he signed with cnn
but here's gavin newsom
but here's one that i loved the most
but i don't believe he said it
but i got the people that we needed
but i hit her too early but now it doesn't matter
but i think ultimately we win that one
but i've warned the ayatollah and the government of iran that they must not harm hurt or kill any protesters
but ice officers in this region of our country arrested nearly 7000 illegal aliens with criminal records
but it's the beep
but make america great again maga has never won one of these polls
but mexico didn't pay
but no seriously we're all smart people
but our great warriors carried out a daring nighttime raid and terminated the founder and leader of isis
but right now it's with the united states military
but she said that bernie said 
but sinks toilets and showers you don't get any water
but taking their cues from socialist bernie sanders aoc all these people liberal lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million americans of their private health insurance
but that's why this november we're going back and we're going to win the house
but that's why we have the best unemployment rates we have the best employment rates
but the democrats are doing everything possible to disparage what we did with the hit on this monster
but the democrats are outraged that we kill this terrorist monster even though this monster was behind hundreds and hundreds of death
but the fake news doesn't tell you the right story
but the fake news doesn't tell you the right story
but they did go after him but he didn't knock down out
but they were sitting there and they were calling a roll call in the plane
but they're the party of late term abortion socialism and corruption
but think
but think of this because this is what it's about
but this is all based on a simple phone call that was totally appropriate where the president of ukraine said there was no pressure on us
but under the trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest fastest and largest games
but we are building this wall
but we are defenseless no more because at long last you have a president who puts america first
but we got rid of the estate tax on small farms and businesses and really great things
but we have less than three
but we passed bi-partisan criminal justice reform and that's helped so many people
but we won 32 states
but we're a movement for all americans who believe in fairness and justice equality and dignity opportunity and safety
but we're getting the hell out of there okay
but we're going back and we're going to hold the senate
but we're watching it
but we're winning
but we've created 7 million jobs since the election including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs
but you have no water coming in
but you know what
but you know what if you want you have it
but you know what's going to happen to their industry
but you wouldn't have bought those hats
by the way by the way could you imagine if it were the other way around and i spied on his campaign
by the way no estate tax on those beautiful farms
by the way very close to 160 million people are now working in the united states
call me donald
can you imagine
can you imagine his phone calls
china is now putting a big stop a big lid on fentanyl which is a disaster coming out of china

he sounds like our kind of a guy
he was a bad guy in every way
he was a designated terrorist by president obama who didn't do anything about it as usual
he was not a sweetheart
he was that
he was the best in the world right here from wisconsin right
he was the king of the roadside bombs
he was this
he would climb that sucker
he's a nasty guy
he's going to win
he's never going to leave
he's never leaving
he's now at large

i called the guy 
i can get whatever i want in terms of money except for a wall

i can't say more but just as important because we need time for that tree to grow
i did pull out
i don't believe that bernie said that
i don't have to go through the whole deal
i don't know if you've seen
i don't know maybe the most important ever but it was so important
i don't particularly like him
i don't think i can talk to somebody about them for 45 minutes that i don't even know
i don't think so
i got it approved and from the day it was approved i got no thanks i got no credit
i got it done
i got to tell you they love it right

i had no idea it would be that bad
i hate to say remember the democrats

now the caliphate is 100% destroyed
now the democrats should be outraged by soleimani's evil crimes not that decision to end his wretched life
now they say 
now we're building the wall
now when they say you know what that means right
now you can buy them it doesn't mean a damn thing
now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for you the people of wisconsin

right here in wisconsin cities run by far left politicians are releasing dangerous criminal aliens who abuse assault and threaten innocent children
ron johnson all those guys

saudi arabia russia but we're number one by far
schooling
senator ron johnson is here
she had such a passion for it
she just hit 14 million people have been trained by these great companies
she ought to spend more time back in san francisco taking care of her community instead of wasting everybody's time
she said right that bernie stated strongly that a woman can't win for president
she was going to get trained get into companies
she's not going anywhere
she's very smart
should be
should be to iraq
sir maybe none
sir we'll be there tomorrow
so after years of devastating defense cuts we have fully rebuilt the united states military to a point that it has never been before and it's now more advanced more lethal and more powerful than ever

so i said all right good
so if you're one of them this doesn't help you because you'll save some tax
so in the meantime if you own a home on beverly hills they scream at you if you want to water your grass a little bit right
so it surprises me every single time
so it's really going to be something and we're in a little fight with california over that
so jim if they've given you a hard time come on over to the republican party
so let's do it real fast
so now if you love your children and you have a farm or a small business or small ranch or even a large ranch you have no estate tax
so now the people of wisconsin are going to say well let's see the state set a record most successful it's ever been
so she had a goal of a half a million people
so she'd call walmart she'd call exxon she'd call all these great companies
so the new light bulb costs you five times as much and it makes you look orange

so they're building them here
so we finished it off to 100%
so we kill him

so we're getting rid of the restrictors
so what they've done is paid him money to silence him because he has a very important voice
so you have 7000 illegal aliens having criminal records including those charged or convicted of murder burglary robbery drug crimes killings in the most violent way
so you're in there five times longer than you're supposed to be
soleimani and the head of hezbollah they were talking about weddings working out

and by the way on that ad i know some horrible people horrible human beings some of the worst people in the world i really do they're horrible none of those people and they're the worst the worst real estate developers in new york you don't get much worse
and by the way the us marshals did a great job in portland
and by the way we're doing great
and don't let them ruin the suburbs because the suburbs are a special place
and driving here there were tens of thousands of people on the streets with flags
and during the violent demonstrations in las vegas a 29 year-old police officer you know about this was deliberately shot in the head while he was doing his job a vicious criminal left he was a left person a left
and everybody's upset about it
and everyone's raising hands
and fortunately four years ago we weren't discouraged because if we would have believed the polls nobody would have voted
and he always says 
and he calls law enforcement biden called law enforcement the enemy
and he goes to texas and he goes to oklahoma and he goes to north dakota and he goes to all these places
and he has stated that if he is elected charter schools are 
and he raised his hand no fracking
and he says 
and he was right about that because nobody else does either
and he will drive you out of the suburbs
and he would hand your country over to the socialists
and he'd allow violent mobs to burn down your business
and he'll say 
and he's calling this governor who was a political hack he was a political hack and then he became governor
and he's going places but you have to watch
and he's talking about this is all fake news and nobody would have known
and he's watching very closely
and here's another governor in charge of millions of ballots
and here's the problem
and hopefully the court's going to rule because this is the greatest scam in the history of presidential politics
and i don't mean like 1%
and i got to know president xi of china very well president putin of russia kim jong-un
and i have 25 real witnesses with the names with everything saying it never happened
and i mean ninth month ninth month ninth month
and i said 
and i said 
and i said when i won i said 
and i say it all the time and that's what makes me happy
and i was out here and that right about that
and i was talking the other day 
and i would say she'll be president
and i'll tell you adam please he's a great lawyer a great talent
and i'll tell you what whether it's in north carolina whether it's in michigan whether it's in other states where they're sending out they're going to be sending out 80 million ballots
and i'm asking joe biden to do the same thing but he can't because he's got a bunch of radical left maniacs that they want to put on the court
and i'm being nice when i say it
and i'm in favor of our great second amendment guns
and i'm the one that got it done
and i'm thrilled to be in douglas county but people are coming from all over the place
and i've been at it
and if it was me that got caught forget about it
and if joe gets off the stage walks off the stage if he makes it which i think he probably will in all fairness he's been doing this for 47 years right
and if they wrote about it properly it would be a proper thing a proper thing to do
and in my opinion if you look at what he's going to do to medicare they will destroy social security
and it could all be stopped
and it ended up our crowd turned out to be a lot bigger than nbc which is owned by concast
and it should never happen to another president
and it starts with a c
and it's a horrible thing and we've stopped so much of it
and it's a manifesto and it reads far worse than anything bernie sanders ever said
and it's been a horrible program
and it's democrats
and it's really quite nice
and it's so easy
and it's true
and let me just tell you something
and look what we did just yesterday in europe and look what we did with israel and you just saw that with united arab emirates and bahrain
and louisiana now they had a spike but they had the spike but the spike was able to be handled because now we understand
and nobody can get elected not even with democrats rational democrats will they vote for some of these people to be on
and nobody treated him worse than kamala
and nobody's done to china what i did
and now he's in charge of the election and the millions of ballots
and now sleepy joe is saying that no no no
and now the mueller scam these people the worst people
and now we're doing it again
and now we're doing it again except we're doing it very rapidly
and now what he's doing is he's playing tough guy that he's tough on crime
and on november 3rd you will save america
and on the other side drugs suicide depression substance abuse of different kinds heart disease
and people are throwing bottles at him he's being hit with tear gas
and remember he said 
and she and her lawyer deleted 33000 emails after she got a united states subpoena
and she was 100% right it produced 250000 jobs for south korea not for us
and so every place we've touched we solved the crime but they have to ask us
and that didn't work out too well for them
and that includes 2016 where the enthusiasm obviously was great
and that includes by the way leaders of foreign countries that aren't our friends okay
and that's because you had the lowest job numbers in the history of our country
and that's going to change the whole makeup of the supreme court
and the fact is the republican party doesn't play it rough and tough like those people they don't play it the same way
and the the young officer as you know he's a young brilliant young guy and he's totally paralyzed
and the wall will very soon be finished
and then after that we'll negotiate right
and then he says 
and then he wants to do a complete shutdown
and then i see a sign in front of joe right here right here it said buy american
and then she said 
and then she took her telephones and she smashed them with a hammer
and then she took the other ones and she deleted them
and then the votes started coming in
and then they said 
and then we're supposed to win these states and we have a guy that would do that where he won't let us have and we call it a protest and therefore we can do it
and then yesterday we were nominated a second time for another nobel prize
and then you read these fake reporters and they say 
and there's no reason for that
and there's nobody that loves our military respects it and the people more than me
and these are statistics that come from people that do this stuff right
and they all said 
and they are the only people that i will pick
and they had licensing
and they put an ad like that up they're a disgrace
and they want the american dream and they don't want that to happen
and they want to keep them out of church
and they wanted corey booker to head that program
and they're seeing a spike
and they're unsolicited
and this is just arithmetic
and this is the guy that we're entrusting with millions of ballots unsolicited ballots millions and millions
and together with the incredible people of nevada we will make america wealthy again
and we are bringing our troops home as we speak tonight
and we are making it greater than it ever has been
and we are winning in florida by a lot so that's good
and we built now over 320 miles of border wall and are adding 10 new miles a week
and we can't allow that to happen
and we couldn't
and we did things that people said couldn't be done
and we have better policy
and we keep saying 
and we opened but we would have had 2 million two and a half or three million people
and we pass record tax cuts and regulation cuts to keep the family farms and ranches in the family
and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
and we will end our reliance on china once and for all
and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto 
and we will teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
and we'll further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs
and we'll start by saying we're going to start by saying that the democrats are trying to rig this election because it's the only way they're going to win
and we're developing a vaccine in record time
and we're leading with the hispanic community
and we're not thrilled
and we're trying to get big 10 football by the way but we won't even
and we're winning with them
and we've done this in record time years ahead of schedule
and what he said is amazing
and what we did we saved millions of lives because i hated to do it but we had to close it up understand this disease and then open up again
and who was the worst
and with that comes tremendous crime
and without them we wouldn't be here
and yesterday he made i think he made a mistake
and yet pathetic joe and he's a pathetic human being to allow that to happen
and you don't hear that from the fake news
and you know what back there and i'll tell you it's hurting our country
and you know what made it that way is the internet
and you know what they have to pay a price for the damage and for the horror that they've caused they have to pay a price
and you know why i add the word he said because they will take what i said and they will put it as a commercial
and you look over his shoulder and the entire city was burning
and you say 
and you see people
and you see what's going on there
and you're sitting there i said 
antifa
anybody
are they sending them to certain areas and not other areas
are they sending them to democrat areas
are we leading i hope
are you awake sir
are you doing well
arizona governor's done a great job
as soon as i hear somebody's born for running for president i said 
as vice president he presided over the worst and the weakest and the slowest economic recovery since the great depression
at least here they have us even in a lot of places
be careful of the ballots that's the only way we're going to lose
be quiet please
because at no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties or two visions two philosophies two agendas for the future
because for 47 years joe biden did the opposite
because he wants to be like correct with covid but it's not really because they can't get anybody to fill up a room
because he'd do everything wrong
because i don't know if you can ever come back from what will happen including our supreme court
because if you don't vote for trump in the suburbs okay
because they don't want it to happen before the election
because we won by so much that they can do it simultaneously by saying 
because you think it was easy doing that
behind her it looked like 25000 people
being in real estate and being in new york and being in all over i've seen a lot of dishonest people
ben they're going to destroy the suburbs
beto
beto beto
beto beto
biden and his party of liberal hypocrites want to lock law-abiding americans in their homes which is what they're doing
biden has pledged to abolish the production of american oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas and he wants to ban fracking right
biden pledges to oppose school choice
biden voted for the iraq war
biden would terminate this comeback
biden's record demonstrates that if he had been in charge when the china virus arrived hundreds of thousands of more americans would have died
biden's surrendered your jobs to china
blood in the sand
boy they covered
boy you are really back far
bring it up closer i can't see it dammit
but always follow their first instinct because the first instinct is what is going to happen
but beto went totally south
but biden wants to raise your taxes so high
but biden's plan is to appease domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists
but darling they gave you the answers and the questions
but don't let them ruin the suburbs because they will put that regulation back immediately immediately
but follow the original statements because that's what's going to happen
but he did his last event but he was so bad
but he goes from let's not give the police any money
but he said it better than anybody i've heard
but he said there'll be no fracking under my administration
but here we are and this is really amazing
but here we are and we're going to be here for another four years
but i believe it's worse than socialists
but i can be bad to him because he put the most vicious ad on television that i've ever seen
but i did the right thing for our country and we want to have our great plants working
but i like it anyway
but i'll tell you no administration in three-and-a-half years no administration has done what we've done in the first three-and-a-half years
but if he gets in they will open up that whole program
but if you want to go to church you can't do it
but listen he said 
but look at what we've done
but most of the victims are women children to a much lesser extent but women and human traffickers
but nbc is the worst of them all not one mentioned
but now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob
but now i see buy american
but remember when beto said 
but she said 
but the hispanics get it
but the next president and you saw i put out a list of an additional number of very conservative highly thought of highly respected judges
but the program was already doing damage
but then they really did with this last one because if pocahontas elizabeth warren if she would have left the race one day before the big super tuesday i mean bernie would have her philosophy right
but there's a lot of harm done on the other side
but these radical lefts will be running the department of justice the department of homeland security and the united states supreme court
but they are bad people
but they got caught and somebody said 
but they have a regulation
but they have to respect law and they have to have order
but they want to punish you for praying in church while they let agitators and arsonists burn your churches down
but two months two and a half months later he admitted that i was right
but unsolicited where they take millions of ballots
but we could have
but we ended up winning michigan first time in decades
but we would've had two and a half three three and a half million people
but we're defeating the china virus
but you do notice that i hope
but you know the good part
but you know what
but you know what
but you want to go pray in church they won't let you do that
but you want to know something
but your governor tried to stop us
buy america
by the way all of these places were talking about are democrat run chicago new york portland seattle
by the way the reason we show so many cases because we have the best testing program in the world by far by far
by the way we could do it in portland in half an hour
by the way what happened to the war
c-o-n concast
c-o-n-c-a-s-t concast
can't have this happen to our country
chicago
chicago a few weekends think of it 72 people shot this is shot
could i ask the fake news to take your cameras and show all the way back there for hundreds of yards all the way back there
could you turn the television off just for a minute just for about three seconds
dad you can't take this money away
darling let's go out to dinner
darling somebody just moved next door
darling we're out of here
did every possible thing wrong
did i just see 38 people were shot
did you ever give me questions back there
did you ever hear of winston churchill
did you know that
did you see he copied everything i was doing
did you see it
did you see the other day now they're finding out that to do an interview an interview they ask him a question
did you see the poll
did you see where they said
different kinds of a disease a little bit
do we have any young children here
do you ever see him with his little circles
do you ever watch where they're very critical of me
do you know that
do you know that
do you know that
do you know what i'm talking about
do you remember the scene
do you want to shout it out
does anybody know that
does anyone have a small farm medium-sized farm or business
doesn't work that way anymore
dogs got ballot
don't forget when you do these shutdowns your state is shut down
don't have the rally
don't let them ruin the suburbs
don't say that
donald trump went down substantially in the polls like about 40%
donald trump will not do well with women
donald trump wins the state of georgia
donald trump won the great state of texas
earlier this year i kept my promise to american workers
end it i want to end it
europe's excess mortality rate is 24% higher
every one of them all of them
every sixth time i'd say 
every statistic was the best
everybody wants a vaccine
everybody's getting ballots
exactly right
except one thing he wouldn't have closed the country to china so hundreds of thousands of people would have died from that
florida is way down
for years you had a president who apologized for america
four more years four more years four more years four more years four more years four more years four more years four more years four more years
from carson city to elko from las vegas to reno and from clark county to right here in douglas county we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded american patriots who poured out their heart sweat and soul to secure our liberty
go ahead shout
go as far as the eye can see
go into our country
gone

he didn't even know he had no idea why he got it
he does whatever his left wing puppet masters demand you know that
he doesn't know he's alive
he doesn't know he's alive
he goes 
he goes 
he got screwed
he hardly used the beds at all
he hardly used the ships at all

he opposed killing soleimani
he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden
he oversaw the rise of isis and he cheered the rise of china as a very positive development

he supports taxpayer-funded extreme late-term abortion
he thought this was easy didn't he
he treated obama good
he tried to stop us
he wants to end it
he wants to get political with me
he wants to take guns away from everybody
he was a real left all right
he was a vice president for eight years and he only did one thing good
he was great
he was great today
he will totally destroy social security
he won't win there
he would end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions 700% opening the flood gates to terror-afflicted nations
he would eradicate your economy
he would put your families in danger
he would terminate this comeback
he wouldn't even think about it
he wouldn't even think about it
he'd do everything wrong
he'd put on new regulations and it wouldn't be him again
he'd raise your taxes
he'd raised the hell out of interest rates
he'll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal illegal aliens
he'll just be locked up in a room someplace and the radical left is going to be running our country
he'll never be able to protect your family your loved ones or your community
he'll obliterate your second amendment
he's a puppet
he's about like 12

hunter
i always say it and i mean it if you like your children it's great
i asked some people that traveled with obama
i believe that's true
i brought back 650000 jobs
i call it the manifesto with bernie and aoc plus three all these crazy people
i can be really vicious
i do
i do get a kick out of watching a guy 
i do the speech two days later i get a call
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know if you've been seeing the numbers
i don't know that the country will survive 50 years if that happens it might not survive five years if that happens
i don't know what happened
i don't remember
i don't remember
i don't remember doing that
i don't think so
i don't think they'll do too well in texas
i don't want to have a lesser version
i gave $28 billion to farmers
i got it was just reported
i got one day of bad press after that everybody forgot about it
i got to get the hell out of here
i had a great life i'll tell you
i happen to think the postal people are great but what happens if one of the post guys before he gives the ballots he takes a whole handful and hands them to some democrat political operative right
i have a friend a very smart guy very streetwise guy
i have a thousand people here
i have nothing against fracking
i have some things in nevada that are very good to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to america not to china
i hear we're doing well
i hope you're all going to be poll-watchers i hope you are because with you people watching the polls it's going to be pretty hard to cheat
i just asked as we're coming in 
i just looked at a very solid poll
i knew it before i did it but i never knew it to this extent
i knew she was in trouble when she said 
i know all of them
i know but that was a big strain because my eyes i couldn't see the teleprompter
i know it from being in business
i know it's on a lot of television
i know some of the worst people in the world not one person do i know that would say that standing on top of graves of heroes really not one person
i like it
i like it
i love that city so much
i love that state
i made history by signing an executive order making the official policy of the united states government to buy american and to hire american
i made one speech yesterday
i mean 
i mean it
i mean it's happening
i mean let's be nice about it okay
i mean like 20% 25% they're trying to rig the election
i mean that was a strong commercial
i never knew it to this extent
i remember them in the supreme court the little sisters of the poor
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 38
i said it's antifa and i was right
i saved the us auto industry by withdrawing from last administration's job-killing trans-pacific partnership
i tell you he did a great job
i think 1929 would look like good times
i think he has no idea but he's a pathetic human being to let that happen where they put an ad like that where i'm standing over graves
i think he probably will
i think i know
i think it was 31 different phones they deleted
i think it's a step worse than socialist
i think it's just an excuse
i think the media the fake news is the most dishonest group of people i've ever seen anywhere in my entire life
i think they do
i think we have a chance of winning in that state first time in many years for a republican
i think we're all doing well
i think we're all doing well it's like a family
i thought he'd take what bernie did and move them somewhat to the right
i thought we was going to war with kim jong-un
i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's rampant theft of american jobs
i took you out of that crazy paris climate accord because it was totally disaster
i used to be nice about that
i was born for this
i was going to say something else but they would have scolded me
i was right
i was surprised people most people they appreciate what i did
i wish he was going to win but let's go out to dinner
i withdrew from last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal
i wonder what that's all about but that's a criminal thing you did
i would have rather then i could have had the plane right behind me
i would've thought you people would've gotten out there like 
i'll be watching
i'll do one more ronna one more
i'll take it
i'll take it anyway
i'll tell you here because you don't read about that stuff
i'll tell you i wouldn't want to be a cheater
i'll tell you what in the old days i think it should still be news when they broadcast had to be reasonably accurate right
i'll tell you what the polls are worse than the writing
i'm also standing up for religious liberty
i'm exhausted
i'm fighting for school choice safe neighborhoods low taxes and regulations on hispanic-owned small businesses
i'm going there the day after tomorrow
i'm going to bring back manufacturing
i'm going to keep saying it
i'm in favor of religion and god
i'm just reporting this i got zero time on the nightly news on the network news
i'm not kidding
i'm probably forcing him tonight to do something but he should put out a list of his judges so that you know where you stand
i'm running for reelection to bring prosperity to nevada to the whole country
i'm sorry
i'm sorry
i'm staying in your state tonight but i'm going to be going to california
i've been here a long time
i've never seen anything like it
i've spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to america securing our borders rebuilding our military and standing up to china like never before
i've taken billions tens of billions of dollars out of china
if biden wins china wins
if biden wins the mob wins
if biden wins the rioters win the anarchists win arsonists flag burners they all win
if biden's elected his radical supporters won't just cause mayhem on the streets like you're seeing all democrats
if he ever wants she'll be president within the first month or so i would say
if he gets off the stage they're going to say it was the single greatest debate they've ever seen
if he got in we would have the greatest depression in the history of our country
if they don't ask us we're not supposed to do it but maybe we do it anyway
if this was sleepy joe and obama you wouldn't have a vaccine for three years
if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands more americans would right now have died
if you don't like your children it doesn't mean a damn thing don't leave it to them
if you go to new jersey if you go to virginia if you go to pennsylvania if you go to california look at some of these races every one of these races was a fraud missing ballots
if you want to be in a group of people you can't do it
if you want to leave it to your children you don't have to pay tax now because of trump
in 45 minutes it was ended
in all fairness in all fairness to obama and biden i call him obiden because it's easier obiden
in all fairness to obiden i mean they didn't do any of that
in fact he didn't even know why he got it
in fact the peace prize was because i stayed out of wars and by the way ended certain wars that could have happened that you don't even know about
in fact the secretary of state secretary of defense said about him 
in god we trust
in the second term and we've already started it very heavily i will provide school choice to every parent in america
instead of letting washington change us despite all that we've been through and we've been through more than any president has ever been through with these characters and they're falling one after another
instead we have the beast
is that pathetic wheeler is that pathetic
is there a police officer in the country if there is they'll do a commercial
it almost sounds like an ancient crime
it could all be stopped so quickly
it had a big impact but this is what you're buying with a guy like this
it is corrupt
it never happened did it
it never took place what they said
it produced 250000 jobs for south korea
it was actually i thought it would be devastating
it was the most pathetic recovery since the depression
it wasn't that bad
it will be ready before the end of the year and maybe much sooner than that
it will be the people that control him
it would all be over
it would have taken us 20 minutes
it would not have been acceptable would not have been sustainable
it'll be finished
it's a disaster
it's a disaster
it's a disgrace
it's a disgrace
it's a friendly protest
it's a hell of a car
it's a representative of antifa
it's a rigged election
it's a very dangerous thing
it's a very dangerous thing and i totally mean it
it's a walking army tank the beast
it's about forest management and other things but forest management
it's already signed starts on january 1st
it's amazing
it's been very unfair to people with the american dream
it's better than you say it
it's common sense
it's fake and they shouldn't be allowed to do it
it's fake news and it's a disgrace
it's going to be very close
it's good
it's hurting our country
it's just a terrible thing
it's just lucky that there weren't great mass casualties
it's just you know just that time right
it's not
it's not even believable
it's not looking so good
it's not really a good definition
it's not that it's that the fake news would give him the questions
it's okay
it's okay

our american ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth
over the next four years to conclude we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world

people were saying we could go to 41 42% unemployment
phony polls
please darling i want to go to bed

president trump is tied in nevada tied
probably everybody but republican are going to get the ballots
proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
really
really
reimpose crippling federal regulations destroy your social security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions
remember
remember 8
remember beto was interviewed in some magazine or third-rate magazine most of them are but remember
remember last time four years ago 
remember last time remember it's the same thing
remember that
remember the cure can't be worse
remember the debate where they're all standing there and he looked around 
remember they were trying to blame other people
remember when donna brazile gave crooked hillary the questions right
remember you'd catch somebody 
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right now i don't think he believes in anything he just wants to go to sleep
riots you can have they can burn the hell out of the strip
ronna mcdaniel ronna
scott
see it's a suppression but my people might don't get suppressed
see the beast
she called him a racist
she called him everything
she didn't remember
she got a subpoena from the united states congress right
she got out before iowa as i remember
she illegally deleted and her lawyers should go to jail with her okay
she made it no wait she said it's going to produce 250000 jobs
she started off as a favorite
she was at 15
she was going down so fast
she was great
she was horrendous she kept calling me 
she was horrible to him
she was kamala
she was like a dropping rock in water
she was on she said 
she was so tough
she will look at her husband say 
she's another beauty
she's just great
sir 12 billion two years ago and 16 billion last year
sir let's just amend it
sir one more speech please come over
sir please wake up
sleepy joe biden who surrendered you know where he is now he's in his damn basement again
sleepy joe said 
so biden's been going down very rapidly in the polls
so far he's refused to do it
so he can't get anybody to fill
so he now is a big gun guy
so he's against our second amendment
so he's in these debates with the other people and they're just eating him alive
so i don't care if you say it anymore because you know what
so i get off the plane
so i want to start by saying 
so i will tell you this so now we can play it like it is
so i'm going to win pennsylvania but what's he going to do with these ballots
so if anybody asks you outside this is called a friendly protest okay
so if i'm up like millions of votes he can rig the election he can rig the election
so important
so it's an amazing thing
so it's not like they haven't been here
so just to finish on that look just to finish on that he's a guy that tried to silence us by not having this
so many people going out
so not that he has anything to do because he won't know what's happening
so now they're trying to hurt the vaccine
so thank you ronna great job you're doing we appreciate it
so they ask him a question
so they put these big circles
so they sent people that night because they didn't want to be embarrassed
so they want to abolish cash bail like they did in new york
so to do an interview he demands on getting the questions and his people write out the answer
so true
so under my leadership we built the greatest economy in the history of the world
so very importantly get your friends get your family get your neighbors get your coworkers and get out and vote on november 3rd
so we were nominated a few days ago for a nobel prize which is a big thing
so what happens
so when beto was legit and then ted cruz beat him and ted did a very good job
so when we had this pandemic worldwide look it's a terrible thing that a thing like this happened
so when you say solicited because i like solicited better as a word than absentee
so who did biden put in charge
so who the hell is going to trust
so you're going to have a vaccine quickly
so your president gets a nobel and at least a nomination and they don't mention it
some of these are very violent people and we get them the hell out
somebody said 
somebody said 
sonny perdue secretary of agriculture great guy said 
south korea did very well with that deal but i changed that deal a lot
spoke to the folks in oregon washington they never had anything like this but it is about forest management
take a look at what they're doing to pennsylvania
take your cameras
tell me about it
tell me about it
texas is now way down
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you fellas thank you very much
thank you james very much
thank you jim
thank you michael
thank you mike
thank you president trump
thank you president trump i appreciate it sir
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you very much joe i appreciate it
that didn't work out
that is why we're going to win a record share of the hispanic vote in november
that means they're giving him the questions they never gave me questions before
that never happened before
that's a beauty
that's a big statement
that's a great deal we made
that's a long drive
that's a tough job
that's all
that's all you got
that's because of me because if biden were here he'd have about three people
that's exactly what i was going to say but i didn't
that's going to change the whole rationale thinking on so many different subjects like you wouldn't believe including by the way life okay
that's going to destroy your second amendment
that's going to take away your guns
that's how china happened
that's how dishonest these people are
that's how great
that's illegal
that's just a dishonest group of people
that's not a pleasant sight
that's not easy to do
that's not too bad right
that's now a good deal
that's okay
that's one thing
that's republican national committee who we're going to put
that's the end of him
that's the way
that's true
that's what we have by the way a lot more coming in
that's where everyone aspires to and that includes minorities and everybody
that's why for 40 years you got nothing except blood in the sand
that's why i'm doing so well with african american with asian american with hispanic american and with women
the biden shutdown will permanently destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of americans inflict totally lasting harm on our children and lead countless deaths from suicide
the circle
the city is burning down
the concept is really make people feel so that on election they go 
the fact is i did more in 47 months as president than joe biden did in 47 years
the fake news would give him questions but of course now donna brazile works for fox so that's gone a long way
the farmers are doing very well
the governor of nevada he tried to stop us and we went to different venues
the governor tried to stop us he couldn't but think of this he's in control of millions of votes
the guy just really in all fairness i've been here three and a half years
the highest taxes in the land crime all over the place
the new york times hired this pollster this great genius
the nobel peace prize right
the only reason seattle got settled because they knew we were going in
the only way they're going to win is to rig it
the only way we're tied is if they screw around with the ballots which they will do in my opinion
the outbreak was so rampant that obama-biden the administration told states to stop testing immediately and they ordered the cdc to stop counting cases because they looked like hell okay
the polls closed and he won
the polls in georgia have closed
the states that are closed north carolina what he's doing to that great state he's got it locked down shut down
the states that are open are doing great
the suburbs are the american dream
the thing looked like it was 30 blocks it was just burning
the united states has experienced the smallest contraction of any major western nation
the whole world got hit but they stopped it from going into the rest of china
the worst part about that isn't the fact that he's doing that because let's face it he's unable okay
then all night long 
then she went down to 14 to 12 to 10
then she went down to five and four and three two and then she said 
then we'll come home
there are policies biden's pledged to apply nationwide
there has to be a repercussion
there will be no fracking under my administration
there will be no fracking under my administration they'll have me saying that
there's a lot of people for douglas county isn't it
there's a lot of tremendous harm done
there's a young man here he's a very young young man handsome young guy
there's never been anything like this
there's no suppression
there's not even a fraction
these are all controlled by democrat governors like your politically motivated governor
these are criminals we're dealing with
these are far left lunatics that biden selects to staff his government
these are great people the greatest people there are and i'm standing over there and they have some sleazebag reporter from a third rate magazine having some source quoting me saying i won't even use the term but saying bad things
these are the worst human beings of all
these extraordinary patriots deserve our admiration gratitude and respect not joe biden's contempt
these guys that are lecturing all the time they don't have a clue
these people are corrupt
these people these people
they actually have places seattle they actually don't want to have police
they all deleted
they all used the same mistake
they are fighting and it's dangerous it's dangerous
they are the only people that i will consider for the supreme court of the united states
they can burn the hell out of reno
they can do whatever the hell they want if it's a riot
they did a great job
they did the heavy lockdowns just like you're doing right here
they don't care about the air and they should and they should which is another problem
they don't even have to have an authorized signature in nevada
they don't have 18 people killed or 12 people in a short period of time
they don't like me too much
they don't like to mention the name antifa
they don't like to write it
they don't like to write that
they don't want to have police
they forced him out of his home
they get hit by biden
they get it like very few people get it
they go 
they got caught
they got hit so hard
they got hit so hard by oh biden
they got nothing
they had a poll today that with the hispanic voter they call them latino hispanic
they had a small crowd a insignificant crowd in a great location
they have all fake polls
they like people that are going to produce jobs
they love those endless wars
they never gave me the questions
they play together
they really are bad news
they really do
they release people the horrible criminals in new york they release them no cash bail
they said manufacturing jobs are dead right
they said millions of ballots
they said what's better they said what's better
they say 
they say 
they say 
they send 80 million ballots out
they send it to you
they should make people if you register if you want a solicited ballot that's where you ask for it
they shouldn't be allowed
they still don't know but we've done a lot of things
they stopped it from going into china but they didn't stop it from coming into the us and europe and 188 countries
they think it's doing great
they use different terms
they want to abolish bail
they want to burn the churches down and that's fine
they want to secure our liberty
they went crazy
they went through two weeks
they were clueless
they were great business people and they get it
they were playing with the zoning so they could build projects in the suburb projects in the suburbs
they were targeted
they were very tough
they will
they worked for the democrats
they'll figure a way
they'll never find the emails because they were acid washed deleted
they're already starting
they're bad people
they're better than anybody else
they're burning minneapolis
they're burning the poor city down
they're clueless
they're doing much better than the ones that are closed
they're doing very well
they're fighting god they're fighting guns and they're fighting oil
they're going to open it up on steroids
they're going to open it up to a level that you wouldn't have believed possible
they're gone
they're hispanic they're black they're asian it's the american dream
they're incredible people more than half of whom happen to be hispanic-americans
they're like 300% up in crime
they're like these wealthy spoiled kids that have no clue about life
they're not going to be leaving your community going to mexico making a product selling the product back in not being taxed at the border
they're not the enemy
they're our friends
they're our great friends
they're seeing a big spike in cases over there
they're sending them to dogs
they're spending millions of dollars on negative commercials
they're the biggest problem that this country has is the fake news media worse than the democrats because the democrats are their partners
they're too nice
they're trying to rig an election and we can't let that happen
they're very unhappy about that
think about it
think if you at a half a million people spread throughout the country that were criminal illegal aliens
think of it
think of it
think of it and defend our freedom
think of it he's been there 47 years
think of it the president of your country is honored by being nominated for the nobel peace prize and your nightly news abc which is terrible cbs which is terrible and probably the worst of all owned by concast they spend a fortune on pr and then every time i get up i call them concast and sort of wipe out their fortune
think of that
think of that
think of that number
this and that and one after another
this guy is the worst
this guy was great
this guy you're going to have portland's all over this country
this is a friendly protest
this is a more important election than four years ago i'll tell you more important
this is getting embarrassing
this is going to be the greatest victory
this is not done by my secretary
this is not the guy you want
this is something
this is the craziest thing
this is the guy that worked for him in charge of the swine flu
this is the man that's going to tell us all about building ventilators
this is the only thing in the world
this is tough stuff
this is what you're going to have
this officer loves sleepy joe biden he's so tough on crime
those roads are going to get very nice
three 46
through our historic relief programs we've saved more than half a trillion nevada cops and jobs and all of this yet
to a debate
to have an ungrateful governor in new york cuomo to have an ungrateful governor
to me i just loved the people
to me it's a big thing even though obviously it's a very political thing but it's a very big thing
today they can do whatever the hell they want
tonight our hearts are with all of the communities in the west battling devastating wildfires
trump is going to be a war at within the first week after he wins
trump is leading biden
trump is leading biden with the hispanic community
trust government
unless somebody comes in and decides to quadruple your taxes then i can't
unlike biden while i'm president of the united states i will always stand with the heroes of our law enforcement
using him as just an excuse to get the super libs in there so they can destroy our suburbs demolish our second amendment erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-american lies in school

you didn't think you'd ever see those prices those under two dollar prices did you
you don't think of it
you don't think of minneapolis that way right
you get it because you can't be there
you got a governor
you got hit hard
you got to ask them 
you got to see what they are doing between him and de blasio
you had the best home ownership
you have my endorsement but i will tell you this adam if you could because you're doing a fantastic job watching watch all these votes coming in on the ballots the unsolicited ballots
you have this fake cnn reporter what's his name
you have to be the most honest guy in the world to go through three years of investigations where they have the worst human beings in the world
you have to sign papers
you have tremendous problems on the other side
you know how great it was
you know how much experience he had
you know it's true
you know my personality right
you know that
you know that especially with ventilators and equipment and masks and shields
you know that you know that they're going to say 
you know the hispanic-owned small businesses they're great business people
you know they gave him millions of dollars shortly before because he never called one wrong
you know we have a debate coming up in three weeks
you know what
you know what
you know what
you know what i got
you know what i mean
you know what i used to stand back and i'd say 
you know what that is
you know what the problem is it's habit
you know what we are now
you know what you're talking about
you know who i'm talking about
you know why
you know why he puts the circles
you know why that's too fast
you mean with bullets
you saw the commercial we put up
you see
you see he says 
you see that
you see what's going on with all these democratic or i always say democrat-run cities and states
you send it back
you shut down except if you have a riot
you think joe biden would even think about it
you think joe is going to be able to build thousands of ventilators a month
you understand that
you want it you sign papers
you won't believe how many people
you're doing well i saw a good poll for you too
you're going to have the suburbs they have a plan
you're my kind of people
you're not going to burn our city hall
you're not going to see companies leaving for mexico very much anymore
you're not shut down for riots
you're supposed to choose the people that did well
you're talking about saving america
you're trying to hurt this country by saying bad things about the vaccine because we're going to produce it early
you've heard that before
you've seen the numbers
your stocks are going to go down like you never saw anything go down before
zero zero
‘cause we're probably based on the way we were treated we're probably entitled to another four after that
-mexico-canada agreement usmca a giant victory for our farmers ranchers workers in minnesota
100%
13 months they got to move fast because they're not beating us at the polls and they know it despite the phony polls that you see all the time their phony polls
16 more years
5 billion
5 billion with a b one point five billion dollars
5 trillion because when i took it over it was a mess
a brand new report just came out as i'm walking on the stage
a doctor worked on my face for 10 hours in the field
a man strong guy had tears in his eyes
a mother who was fine 20 minutes ago you think breaking the military line and jumping off and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter jumping on on top of the flowers on top of the american flag
a woman who headed up the great state of michigan for me a state that hadn't been won in a long time by a republican for whatever reason but it hadn't been won
ad plenty of other states too
after i won the last election i said 
after she lost they said 
after years of building up other countries we are finally building up our country
ah we love you with the red shirts
ainsley and steve and by the way brian has gotten a lot better right
all i had to do is say 
all of a sudden they get summoned and they get subpoenaed by robert mueller
all right
also a man you don't want to fight him and you don't want to play him in hockey because he was tough
always just assume you're a little behind but we're going to win this state by so much that people are going to be shocked
america is thriving like never before
america is winning again and we're respected again as a nation
america now has the number one economy anywhere in the world and it's not even close
and a great friend of mine with his incredible family
and a man who gets in the trenches and he just doesn't care
and above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one america
and again tucker's been very good i have to say
and all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed made the middle east really it's less safe it's less stable and it's less secure
and as scott says 
and as you all know to protect our citizens from those who would do harm to us i instituted a very controversial very hard to get travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries
and at some point i'll probably to prove that and i look forward to doing it
and believe me no other president would be doing that
and by the way the other side we can talk about that lost millions of lives
and by the way there's a time to fight
and by the way we're protecting your second amendment
and china has lost trillions of dollars in value
and close to 100000 people wanted to come tonight
and don't forget they're also fighting for their land
and every letter is individually done because sometimes the parents they're grieving and they get together with other parents and i don't want to see that it's like the same letter
and for those of you that have private healthcare health insurance 180 million people they are going to end it obliterate it and most people are thrilled with it
and frankly they are so bad for our country
and he meant it to
and he said 
and he used the word there was no 
and he was saying how the police aren't being allowed to take care of this rally and yet with president obama and bush and all these people they were fine fine
and he's right
and he's talking about this lousy mayor they've got
and her name is ronna mcdaniel
and his father came over to me he said 
and how good does jessie waters do
and i didn't know what he was talking about this is the first time
and i didn't need beyonce and jay z and i didn't need little bruce springsteen and all of these people
and i don't blame china for what's taken place over the last 25 years
and i don't know why but with all of the great people i just introduced for tonight maybe this is the most important person because i turned on a very good show in the morning
and i don't want to do that as president every time a president from a country calls me or i call them we have to release the text
and i don't want to stay
and i gave out the purple heart
and i have to give a shout out to those people there's nobody like them
and i heard this for months and months
and i just thought of it a year ago
and i looked at him i said 
and i meet people that are so beautiful so amazing
and i say it all the time
and i see parents make sounds that were just 20 minutes ago absolutely fine make sounds scream and cry like you've never seen before
and i see the parents and i have to say walter reed i want to just say the doctors there the job they do you know you hear so many complaints about doctors and about the vets and the vets' care and nobody's done better
and i sign those letters and it just it breaks your heart
and i want to thank the country of mexico
and i'll meet them
and i'll tell the colonel i'll say 
and i'll tell you another thing we have to be treated fairly
and i'm also proud to endorse your next republican senator from minnesota a man that i've known a man that is tough and smart a man that's running against somebody that's never done a damn thing in the senate mr
and i'm telling you they did they got worse
and i've done that
and if i do a neutral something neutral it worked out okay not great it's like 
and if she doesn't win lisa we've got an insurance policy lisa
and it's a disgrace
and it's going to keep bad people out of our country
and it's true
and jason did a great job in congress
and jason they can say that about tom cotton
and just in concluding together we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again
and ladies and gentlemen of minnesota i will tell you this with great certainty the best is yet to come
and laura ingraham is knocking them out of the park laura
and many more
and many more
and maybe they'll change and maybe they won't
and minnesota senate majority leader paul gazelka
and mrs
and mrs
and mrs
and mrs
and now the iron range is back in business
and now we are we are policing we are now policing
and omar is one of the three
and one of the big musicians said 
and one of them was so amazing
and right now i can tell you they're not even close
and rush limbaugh sean hannity a lot of people the great mark levin
and scott reported everything about omar is a fraud including her name
and sometimes i go out to a place dover air force base it's a very tough experience
and sometimes i send letters out it's called blue on green where we're teaching people how to fight and then they turn the gun on our soldiers and shoot them in the back
and that as i said no more respect for the police but these are military people and those are police but we are now policing
and that's the hardest thing for a parent
and that's what they continue to try and do
and that's what they were doing
and the democrats knew this
and the democrats want to dismantle our military
and the only reason i released it was that the democrats put out a phony narrative
and the parents understand that right
and the press will not write it
and the supply chain of china which was unbreakable is now breaking wide open
and their parents were there crying
and then nancy pelosi said 
and then she saw the call and she said to her people 
and then they complain
and then they fly to china and i'm dealing with people right now
and there is nothing that makes me happier than making that decision to run and win and straighten out the mess that these people have created
and there's no plan like those plans
and these guys don't even question it
and they could be so good for our country
and they destroyed their lives
and they did
and they killed me for that
and they knew that my election would finally end their pillaging and looting of our country
and they said 
and they see sights that you and i hopefully will never see
and they told me everything and then we built some alternative walls
and they understand that
and they want to erase your future
and they would've given me all the financing i wanted for the wall
and they're always saying the same thing
and this is a serious wall
and to protect our industrial backbone i placed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel
and today i got a call from one of the top representatives he said 
and trump does it without a guitar
and we called them i called them myself in many cases i said 
and we had receptivity that was unbelievable
and we have 25000 people that we still love outside
and we have a particular colonel that's all he does
and we have no choice
and we have to promise them no more than 16 years
and we live by the words of our great national motto in god we trust
and we will only fight to win
and we won
and we won
and we won very quickly
and we work hard with the christians
and we're living through the insurance policy
and we're rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before
and we're thrilled to be joined tonight by some incredible people that have helped me so much
and we've set every record at every place virtually that we've gone
and what do they want to do
and what happened
and what happens is this big incredible machine flies in this tremendous cargo plane and it flies in so powerful so big
and you go over maria bartiromo and the great lou dobbs
and you know hispanic they understand borders better than anybody better than we do
and you know what
and you know what
and you know what
and your father was never considered smart
anybody like that
anyway good luck jason
as our brilliant white house counsel wrote to the democrats yesterday he said 
as you know for many years leaders in washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers
at 269
because i want it
because i was told by these fraudsters back here in the media that trump cannot get to 270
because like strzok with his insurance deal this was before remember this this was before that statement was made months before i took office
because they never thought in a million years that i was going to release a transcript of the call
because they took it away from him
because we're dealing with some very sick and deranged people
because what are you going to do against president xi and kim jong un
best iron ore there is anywhere
blackmail
bob come up
boy that's a lot of media
brad parscale
bring our troops back home
but a woman who would call me constantly
but from now on we want to fight where it is to the benefit of the united states of america not to the benefit of other countries
but he said 
but he's totally owned and totally controlled by the washington swamp for many years
but here's the thing
but honestly all evenings are electric
but honestly the truth is with time i love you guys whether you're cops police officers law enforcement
but i didn't get to 306
but i enjoy it
but i have to sign these letters
but i kept going
but i lose billions
but i make as president about $450000
but i said 
but i saw these young men and i gave them their purple hearts
but i see this guy and i don't know if he's done a lot of television before but he was very effective and very good
but i send these letters out quite a few
but i think it'll go down and i hope it's going to go down as one of the greatest evenings in the history of this country because it's never happened anything like that before
but i've been rough on them
but if you refuse to bow or bend to the washington swamp which i could do very easily i'd be much more popular
but in the trump administration we will always protect american families first and that has not been done in minnesota
but instead of saying 
but it's like the way they change those tires takes four seconds to change the whole damn thing
but my father would say 
but remember they've been fighting each other for hundreds of years and we were artificially put there in this case by president obama
but she keeps going anyway because the press is fake and they play right into their hands
but that was an amazing evening
but the job he did before the election i came right here to minnesota and i pledged to address this really important issue and it's the issue of law enforcement
but there's a time and there's not necessarily a time
but these are great great people
but these doctors at walter reed and these army and marine and the medical doctors they are unbelievably great people
but they said 
but they smear you they spy on you and they target your friends your family your staff for harassment for abuse for destruction
but they want to make it
but they weren't allowed to do the job for us and they went wild
but they will fail because in america the people rule again
but they're fighting
but they're our boy and they're our girl and it doesn't matter how old we get and how old they get is that a correct statement
but they've been very nice
but we got it for the right price
but we won the point
but we're ripping them all up and redoing them and they're going to be very good
but when we say something about the united states you just don't say america with any intensity
but you know what
but you've got to hear jay z the words he was using he was using the f word all over the place and then the next day they say i use bad language
by the way whatever happened to hunter
by the way when you run if you're running the electoral college is like the 100 yard dash and the total vote you don't go certain places
call me donald
call me donald please
can you believe it
can you believe we're here three years
can you imagine if i didn't
colonel i think they're doing great
come up here
congratulations by the way
congratulations mr
congress should pass usmca immediately
congressman lewis thank you very much and thank you for putting up with all of this stuff because i'll tell you it's going to be nasty
congressman pete stauber
congresswoman omar is an america hating socialist
cops love trump trump loves cops
darling we're going to finally get respect
dear mr
dear mr
dear mr
democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities and we're not letting it happen anymore
democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant washington corruption
democrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy
do me a favor richard
do well
do you mind
do you remember that just 19 minutes after i raised my hand and took the oath of office the washington post a terrible newspaper that doesn't know how to write the truth published a story and in this case they might've gotten it pretty correct they said 
do you remember the evening that we won
do you think you have it bad now
do you understand that
does it cure headaches
does that ever happen
don't forget that's when he was vice president
don't worry about it
don't worry about it
don't you ever do that again
during this call
electoral college
emoluments
emoluments
even the smart guys on wall street and i know all of them they are smart
every once in a while you have to change course and do what you have to do
every one of them plus many others 
every time they talk about him
everybody comes
everybody that looked at it
everyone said 
famous shot
father was crying he said 
finally i'll get some great press
finally it's okay
flies in on air force two with his father the vice president
folks it would be so much easier
for the next 13 months think of that it seems like yesterday for the next 13 months we are going to fight with all of our heart and soul and we are going to win the great state of minnesota in 2020
for the total vote i'd go to four states maximum right
for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
fox and friends
gee
gee i'm sorry i'm so sorry
give him the electric chair
going to be done
good
good
good
got the approval from ukraine
great
great guy
great people
greg used to hate me
guy walks in no experience no nothing
had they waited one day longer they would have had the transcript of the actual call word for word
hard to believe actually
hardest thing
he can not get to 270
he cannot do it
he cannot get to 270
he doesn't even know what they're talking about
he glued the bones together
he goes in he has a meeting he walks out in his fund with 1
he just won not that recently but pretty recently and i was out here campaigning for him and working hard and it turned out to be an easy race because everyone loves him and respects him
he knows
he knows a great deal about all those tangled lies of omar
he knows i love the cops
he knows i've been good to as my father would say 
he knows i've been good to law enforcement
he knows that and so does everyone else
he lost and then he lost at the appellate and then he won at the united states supreme court
he lost on the travel ban
he loves this country
he loves this state
he loves you
he meant a lot
he rebuilt my nose
he rebuilt my nose with glue
he said
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said there were a thousand fragments
he said there were a thousand fragments
he used terrible language
he used that term
he wants to win for the people
he was great
he was never considered a good senator
he was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss barack obama's ass
he was tough but he was great
he wasn't talking politics
he won 18 indy 500s 18 roger penske
he wrote some stuff i can't believe it
he'd do about two songs and leave
he's a friend
he's a great businessman very successful
he's already gone
he's been good
he's been great
he's definitely looking down not looking up
he's my boy
he's my little six foot six boy eric trump
he's smart
he's too perfect this guy
her life became hell
here are the three choices
here's hunter being examined by sleepy eyes chuck todd or some of these people
here's the thing
hey do you guys mind
hey fellows i have an idea for a new t-shirt
his education is incredible his military career has been incredible
honestly i'm the president that they can't talk to me anymore
honestly sir i've never seen anything like this
how about greg
how about on the newscast like the word 
how are you doing
how can you do business that way
how come if they say it's going to take anywhere from a year to two years you say you can do it so quickly
how did it happen
how did it happen
how do you have such a person representing you in minnesota
how good
how good are they
how good was he as a witness
how the hell do they do it
how unfair are we treated
how would you like to have joe biden take over negotiations right now with china
hunter i know they're giving you approximately $168000 a month
hunter it's so great that you're here sir
hunter you know nothing about energy you know nothing about china you know nothing about anything frankly
hunter you're a loser
i actually said 
i blame the people that led our country that let that happen where hundreds of billions of dollars a year was taken from our country to build china
i came down to washington with incredible people
i can think about everything perfect
i could name many people one in particular who came down an incredible young woman
i don't care
i don't care
i don't know
i don't know how parents can do it even
i don't think i've ever said it in a speech but they'll find out if i did
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't want it
i don't want to talk to her
i flew to iraq i met with the generals right
i gave out five purple hearts
i get a call the next morning 
i give it away
i go to walter reed on friday and i do it quite often
i got to 306
i greet the dead
i greet the dead sir
i guess he's right about that
i guess it wasn't sophisticated
i guess we didn't have the right candidates right
i guess you'd say he's brilliant
i had a lot of the rhinos fighting me
i had a week of like 
i had every democrat in congress fighting me fighting me fighting me
i had such a headache almost as bad as listening to mike's damn commercials about those pillows
i have all of them
i have to ask
i hear it's going to take a year to two years
i hear they paid you a big check of $3 million
i issued an executive action making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state
i just want fairness
i just want to speak on behalf of nbc who's absolutely one of the worst
i know everyone
i know the people of minnesota and i want to tell you and i also at the same time it's both a question and a statement how'd the hell did that ever happen
i know you people
i know you people
i let you fight
i like that
i look 
i look at these trade deals and i say 
i look up the guy is already gone
i lose billions being president
i lost and then i lost again but then i won and we have the travel ban
i lost and then i lost at the appellate division and then i won at the united states supreme court
i love maine
i love the cops
i love the cops but let's do another t-shirt
i love the police all of it
i love trump
i love you peter
i love you too lisa
i make the trip i go back home
i mean it's so many shirts so many red shirts and there are plenty of people here without the red shirts and i want to just tell you the respect that we have for law enforcement is unbound
i mean look at their debates
i met with the generals
i needed one point
i never hear anything
i never know who they are
i never say this
i never want to have a president hear the words 
i never want to hear a president of the united states hear those words again
i promised you that as president i would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said to the first lady 
i saw that door open up with a coffin with a flag over it
i saw you on television tonight
i say 
i say 
i say 
i say 
i say 
i say 
i sign letters 
i tell you it's cost me billions of dollars to be president
i think so
i think we're going to have a turnout the likes of which we've never seen in the history of our country
i think your very weak mayor made a mistake when he took them on
i told this story yesterday i have to sign letters it's the hardest thing i have to do
i used the word hell
i want somebody to call me donald
i want to give you the rolls royce
i want to give you the rolls royce of walls
i want to see hunter
i want to thank our great vice president mike pence and karen pence for being here tonight
i was the messenger but we all worked hard
i went there numerous times
i went to maine four or five times
i went to the border patrol and i sat down with 15 representatives of the border patrol and i said 
i will
i will say this if our opponent had won that election you know what would have happened
i would be in such trouble if i forgot judge jeanine
i'd love to run against him to be honest
i'd say 
i'll be talking to some of the parents and they'll act like they're fine
i'll call you whatever you want
i'll never forget that evening
i'll never forget the night before i was at a tremendous arena
i'll see you later
i'm all for it but the electoral college is better for our country because it forces you to go places that you wouldn't go
i'm also fighting back against years of chronic trade abuse from china
i'm only kidding
i'm so sorry
i'm telling you peter
i'm telling you peter she's going to win
i'm telling you they're sick
i'm very angry at you people right now
i've been going through it now for more time than i've been in office
i've been waiting for a long time
i've called them
i've lost all my friends because they're all scared to talk
i've seen this
if democrats were ever to seize power they would open the floodgates to unvetted uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before
if somebody rents a room someplace and they pay me two months in rent or hotel fees i never heard of the people
if somebody stays from let's say a middle east country in one of my hotels and we charge him 392 dollars and 53 cents for staying and i never heard of the guy and i don't want to hear about him they say 
if you can't beat him in a debate you've got a big problem folks
if you could do it for less and win that's a good thing not a bad thing
if you don't have me your second amendment is gone
in other words you can't win
in the previous administration they put our nation's natural resources under lock and key including thousands and thousands of acres in a place called superior national forest
in the republican party we believe that those who seek to join our society must embrace our values honor our history and love our people
in the twisted worldview of democrats and the media it's okay for politicians to ship our jobs to foreign countries flood our communities with drugs and crime and enrich themselves at america's expense
instead they released it they went early they said all these horrible things
is india
is it china
is it north korea
is it russia
it doesn't matter
it is great to be back in the twin cities with the freedom-loving american patriots who make our country run
it really has
it turns out that joe biden was vice president he worked with the so called whistle blower
it was a total fraud
it was disgraceful
it was like this going crazy and two reporters that hate my guts they looked at themselves they looked at each other
it was one of the highest rated evenings in the history of television
it was so bad
it was terrible what he said about women
it would've been perfect
it's a different race
it's a horrible horrible thing
it's a partnership
it's a talking point given to these fakers by the democrats
it's all right
it's disrespectful
it's going to be easy
it's going to be great
it's going to be nasty
it's going up rapidly and you think that was easy
it's got to grab on and catch so they can't destroy it
it's just another phony story
it's like roger penske when you watch him who's getting the presidential medal of freedom by the way pretty soon
it's like they're afraid
it's much easier
it's nice to be rich i guess
it's not an american made product
it's not an unsubstantiated it's fact
it's not china's fault
it's not unsubstantiated you crooked son of a guns it's 100% true
it's so beautiful
it's so important to me
it's so terrible
it's steel it's hardened concrete it's deep it's high it's a thing of beauty
it's the craziest thing i've ever seen
it's the craziest thing i've ever seen
it's the hardest thing i have to do
it's the usa is the toughest nation to deal with
it's time to bring them home
it's time to bring them home
it's true
it's true
it's true
it's true
it's true
it's true
it's true
it's true
it's true
it's unbound
it's very easy
it's very easy
jason lewis

my administration is also fighting the democrat socialist healthcare agenda that would obliterate medicare
my administration is taking historic action to secure the border
my father used to teach me if you can do it for less and win that's good
my nose was absolutely just blown apart
my phone call as an example with the president of ukraine was perfect
my son did not have a good look
nancy and chuck two beauties have given control of the democrat party entirely over to the radical left including minnesota's own representative ilhan omar
never happens

no sir they're not going to do great
no they weren't biased at all
no they're right about that one
no this is the worst
no you don't want to do that
nobody ever heard of the word emoluments before
nobody ever told me this was the call
nobody fights harder than i do
nobody knows the world of computers better than this guy
nobody thought that could be done
not easy to get them out but we're doing it slowly but surely
not too good and by people that were i call them the 13 angry democrats that turned into 18 angry democrats
nothing was said wrong on that call
now all of a sudden they don't want a wall
now another very special man who's with us today but he'll never be a man to me he'll always be my boy you know what i mean
now he didn't quite say that but i say it
now he's good

omar laughed that americans speak of al-qaeda
omar wrote that israel has hypnotized the world may allah awaken the people and help them to see the evil doings of israel and the united states
on the travel ban
one more time sir
one of your tremendous talented tough congressman tom emmer
one's the mile
or we could mediate a deal between turkey and the kurds
our ancestors crossed the oceans settled a continent tamed the wilderness revolutionized industry pioneered science won two world wars defeated fascism and communism and put a man on the face of the moon
our bold pursuit of this pro-american agenda has enraged and you know what's happened it's enraged the failed ruling class in washington
our country is stronger than ever before because we are proudly putting for the first time in a long time we are putting america first
paul
people that ended up paying far more money in legal fees than they made
peter
please go ahead
please tell me mr
polls are no different than crooked writers
pres who is the toughest nation to deal with
president
president
president
president could i ask you a question
president i can't do it
president on having a truly great great economy
president trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune
president you've been here now for think of it almost three years
previous administrations lust for regime change and also put historic christian communities in vastly more danger than they were before we started
proud citizens like the people of minnesota helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
really
remember i always used to talk about polls i know polls very well
remember that
remember the woman crying
remember they said electoral college
remember when they used to say it
representative omar has a history of launching virulent anti-semitic screeds whether you like it or not
republicans believe american cities should be sanctuaries for americans not for criminal aliens
republicans will protect medicare and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
right
right
right
right
right
right
s
say police officer
say something
scott johnson of power line
scott reports his sources told him that quote omar's legal husband was omar's brother and that she had married him for fraudulent purposes
sean's got the number one show
see he wants to run for more
see he's not getting it built
she had causes that were so good
she is a disgrace to our country and she is one of the big reasons that i'm going to win and the republican party is going to win minnesota in 13 months
she minimized the september 11th attack on our homeland
she pleaded for compassion for isis recruits right here in minnesota
she said 
she said that pro-israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country
she wanted to help people
she wanted to help people and she ended up going home dark dark
she was going to help people
she's been incredible
she's fantastic and she's the head of the rnc
she's giving me a headache
she's going to win
she's going to win 10 million to one
she's great
she's said the us support for israel is all about the benjamins
since coming into office i have reduced refugee resettlement by 85% and as you know maybe especially in minnesota i kept another promise
sir
sir honestly my son looks better now
sir if you make one more trip you're going to win michigan
sir it's incredible
sir my face was blown apart
sir president obama took our heart away took our life away
sir we can do it in two weeks
sir we have no ammunition
sir we have no ammunition
sir we need one more
sir we're going to hit them from the front
sir what is this
sir when that door opens up those same people that you think are okay do things that you'll never see
sir you'll see things that you've never seen before
sleepy joe and his friends out america they didn't have tough negotiations
smart
smith from arkansas
so china gives his son 1
so good
so he says 
so i can give it to health i can give it to transportation i can give it to military but i give it away all the time
so i had no choice
so i kept going to maine and you know what
so in desperate attempt to attack our movement
so in the campaign we spent much less money than crooked hillary clinton much
so in the case of turkey and syria and the kurds we could send in a thousand troops for a military conflict with turkey
so in theory that should be the end of it
so nancy pelosi upon hearing a false story from a whistleblower that had no clue what was going on in that call or somebody gave her very bad advice but also hearing it from shifty shift nancy pelosi said a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the ukrainian president 
so now the democrats are making a pathetic bid to save sleepy joe sleepy joe biden
so people that were going down 
so professional
so speak to your mayor
so the president of ukraine reiterated today at a major news conference on other subjects that he was under absolutely no pressure
so they can't destroy it
so they know they can't win the 2020 election so they're pursuing the insane impeachment witch hunt
so they said 
so they're telling us
so turkey is right now waging a very tough campaign against the kurds
so we did our job
so we do different letters
so we have 20000-plus people inside
so we have the greatest economy the greatest military
so we have three choices
so we released the transcript of the call which was so good that that crooked adam schiff this guy is crooked he had to make up a fake conversation that never happened a fake conversation that never happened and he delivered it to the united states congress and the american people
so we were really forced just to put it away we were forced
so we won 306 and do you remember they sued to say one's the 100 yard dash
so we're doing some things that are pretty amazing
so we're going to pull them out and we're pulling people out and we're trying to make good deals and we're going to bring our soldiers back home and we may need them for something else and they'll be ready
so we're honored to have with us today a special guest a man that really is a terrific talented writer
so we're slowly getting out of the middle east
some people did something
some people did something big deal
somebody from some great state i'm sorry to inform you your son has been killed in combat
sometimes i'll use terrible word like hell
speak of al-qaeda
take a victory take a victory
take a victory united states
take your fighters
take your fighters
tell me
terrible
than they made
thank you

thank you very much
thank you very much mr
that is why from day one the wretched washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election the election of 2016
that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
that only means one thing 
that statement was made months before the election took place
that was 19 minutes after the oath of office
that was a record
that was our victory not my victory
that was terrible
that was the headline
that's a lot of media
that's a nice phrase
that's a strange request
that's great
that's pretty nice
that's really good
that's the biggest patchwork of financing you've ever seen and that sucker is going up and it is the finest it is the strongest it's largely 30 feet tall which is the maximum height that they wanted
that's the hardest thing for a parent when they get notification because they learn how their child has died
that's the most beautiful nose i've ever seen
that's the only reason
that's the way these cops just reacted
that's the way you should do it
that's unbelievable
that's very nice
that's what he does
that's what he does
that's what it is
that's what it is
that's what it's going to do
that's what they do
that's what we have to do
that's what we're doing
that's what's happening
that's why we're doing so well but we're in new mexico and i'm telling you that was electric
the audience was 40% hispanic where we're doing great
the bidens got rich and that is substantiated
the campaign to impeach president trump has begun
the christians the christians
the colonel was telling me that 
the democrats' brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country
the do nothing democratic extremists have gone so far left that they believe it should not be a crime to cross our border illegally and it should be a crime to have a totally appropriate casual beautiful accurate phone call with a foreign leader
the door was opened and these beautiful soldiers five or six on each side lifting the coffin and walking down the runway the plank they call it off this cargo plane
the electoral college i had to go to 22 different states
the fact is we're in a struggle for the survival of democracy in america
the last time i was here a man came up to me he said 
the one that worked the best was the one we're building
the only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing defeat on november 3rd 2020
the only problem is scott it's incredible talent much more talented than most of these people that you heard about
the other day i used the word hell
the phony russia hoax
the place was going crazy
the police
the president of mexico has been incredible
the problem is they never pick it up
the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and it's the party of the american dream
the single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going in to the quicksand of the middle east
the troops have been pulled out
the turks have been fighting with the kurds for two centuries and turkey as you know is a nato ally
the united states has spent $8 trillion in the middle east
the usa
the word hell is a terrible word
their highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions to our system of free elections and to the american people
their treachery is allowed because they go along with the rigged washington game and it is far more rigged
then he ran for office and now he's a united states senator from the great state of arkansas senator tom cotton
then i have all these people that want to stay
then we went outside to the runway and this incredible machine is flying in and it lands and it comes over and it pulls up and we have military guards we have incredible talented musicians that do this
there is nothing that the dirty political establishment hates more than a president that they cannot intimidate own and control
there's no other man that we've ever met that could have taken it
there's no way of doing it and they were right
there's nothing like the dirty political establishment and i have to tell you this is friend of mine very smart brilliant guy was with me about two weeks ago
these are bad people
these are not the same ones but we are doing very well in that negotiation
these are very dishonest people
these aren't the same chinese negotiators that i'm dealing with i can tell you
these corrupt politicians and the radical leftists got rich bleeding america dry
these people and the democrats they're partners
these people are crazy
these people are sick
these people are sick
these wars produced only chaos and bloodshed
they are so bad
they are so dishonest
they are some of the biggest victims of these power vacuums and reckless foreign adventures
they came down they were happy
they came from all of these countries
they came from france
they came from germany
they could be so good
they destroyed great people
they destroyed people good people
they destroyed so many lives
they destroyed so many lives and they're continuing to do it
they destroyed their lives
they don't let us fight
they don't let us fight
they don't let us fight sir
they don't want to pick it up but we pick it up scott and the people get it and we thank you for your great reporting
they fall asleep at a rally
they got bruce springsteen
they got worse
they got worse
they just sit back and say 
they knew
they knew
they know they cannot win
they may be big and strong and older
they respect the office
they ruined people
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they say 
they say 
they say 
they say 
they say 
they see things that nobody will ever see and there's nobody like them
they took people that were full of life and energy and vigor
they treat us great
they understand it better
they understand safety they understand their job they don't want people taking it away they don't want crime
they want to erase your voice
they want to erase your vote like it never existed
they want to spend $99 trillion to redo buildings all over the united states
they want to stay
they wanted to do great things
they wanted to turn the country around
they went home
they were bright eyed and bushy tailed
they were right
they'd come in because she couldn't get a crowd
they'd come in they'd sing
they'd get all these people
they'll give me pinocchios he said it before but i don't know if i ever said this before
they'll say 
they're actually right there tom
they're all electric
they're citizens of france
they're citizens of germany
they're citizens of these various countries in europe
they're crooked polls
they're crooked polls
they're going to make up stories about you
they're going to say things that's going to want to make your wife say 
they're great and they're tough and they are now protecting our border and those numbers have gone down like this
they're in washington
they're looking like this and they're saying 
they're not getting very far
they're terrific people
they're tough as hell those chinese negotiators and hunter who's not too smart hunter
they're trying
they're trying to stop me because they know that i don't answer to them i answer to you
they're vicious horrible and the media was behind every single step
they've never seen anything like that one before
think of it a president of the united states who's made our economy with a lot of help from all of you frankly but from mike and from some of our great senators and some of our great people that we have with us we made this the strongest economy in our history
think of that
think of that
think of that
this feels like the day before the election
this is a great state
this is great
this is nothing but a partisan witch hunt sabotage and i'm sure they're going to say it's totally unsubstantiated but one of them wrote this story
this is really great
this went over and over and over and we ended up winning the state of michigan and i said 
those days are over
time to bring them home
to a parent a child is always their boy or always their little beautiful girl and i know that's probably politically incorrect
to me i'm energized because we're draining the swamp
to the american people
together we will help millions more citizens from welfare to work from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity
tom
tremendous jobs
true
true
trump is getting rich off our nation
tucker and the legendary sean hannity
two months after president obama put joe in charge of ukraine policy they put joe biden in charge of ukraine policy
two points behind
very dishonest people
virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up to the moment of birth
wait until you see what happens
walks out with a billion five
we are also ending the endless wars
we are going to leave it
we are going to win this state in a very short period of time
we are keeping terrorists criminals and extremists the hell out of our country
we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god
we are returning power to you the american people
we begin this campaign with right now almost three years of perhaps the most successful administration in the history of our country
we begin this political campaign with the best record the best results the best agenda and the only positive vision for america
we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
we built about seven of them and then we had climbers come in
we built all different types
we can't let that ever happen again to another president
we captured many many isis fighters
we could hit turkey very hard financially
we did things for the vets that nobody thought would be possible
we do them a great favor and they won't take the fighters
we don't fight to win
we don't fight to win
we don't have any soldiers there because we've left
we don't have any troops
we don't want a wall
we don't want them
we don't want them
we don't want them sir
we gave it back
we go out there and we meet the parents and the families the wives the children the sisters the brothers
we going to hit the hell out of them
we got along with the kurds and we helped the kurds
we got an insurance policy
we got choice for the vets
we got it for the right price
we had a rally three weeks ago in new mexico and new mexico's a hard state for republicans hasn't been won in a long time also
we had a sophisticated campaign
we had just won the greatest campaign in the history of american politics it's true
we had old planes
we had people going to the desert the plane graveyards airplane graveyards picking up parts
we had planes that were so old they didn't fly
we have a lot of great people
we have great generals we have great warfighters and they did it so fast
we have now 27000 mexican soldiers
we have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since may and we are building the wall faster than anyone ever anticipated it could be built
we have seen a plethora of congressional scandals in our history yet we have never seen scandals like omar's in congress and nothing gets done about it
we have to be treated fairly
we have to do it
we have to do it folks
we have to explain to them it's different
we have totally defeated the isis caliphate and i did that in rather quick time if you remember because we have the greatest fighting machine now
we have tremendous evangelical support
we haven't
we haven't had any bad ones
we hope that nancy pelosi can start thinking about passing some legislation instead of thinking about nonsense
we just got rid of the russia hoax and then a week later the ukraine hoax starts
we just set a new record
we knocked out
we left
we left
we meet them and we talked to them and their son or daughter is being flown in from some far away place in a coffin and these things are just impossible
we picked up since the election trillions of dollars in value
we spent $8 trillion and lost thousands of lives
we stand on the shoulders of american patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist in history
we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
we took it from here and we took it from there and we took it from all over the place and we got that thing
we want to fight
we we it's we
we were supposed to be in afghanistan for a short period of time
we were supposed to be in syria for 30 days
we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america within 10 years
we will defeat them
we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
we will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the usa
we will never let it happen
we will not make the mistakes made in european countries that allow a violent ideology to take root in our country on our shores
we won
we won 306 to 223
we won a great political campaign
we won incredible states
we won incredible states

we work hard with the christians
we'll get that son of a bitch out
we're doing it carefully
we're fine
we're fine sir
we're going to determine whether or not we want to make it
we're going to finally get media and press coverage
we're going to get him out
we're going to hit them from the back
we're going to hit them from the sides from underground from overground
we're going to see if we make a deal
we're not fighting we're policing
we're not going to allow it to happen
we're not going to build a wall and they would have forced me to build it
we're not treated fairly by other nations
we're now going to be there for close to 19 years
we're only going to fight to win
we're policing
we're really good
we're replacing the disaster known as nafta with the brand new u
we're taking care of healthcare like nobody's been able to do
we've also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place
we've defeated 100% of that isis caliphate and no longer have any troops in the area
we've done our job we've defeated everyone that we're supposed to defeat
we've got to impeach him
we've got to impeach him
we've had a lot of that a lot of it in afghanistan more than we've ever had proportionately before
we've lost thousands of brave soldiers and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people great people their lives will never be the same
we've now been there for 10 years
we've rebuilt our military
we've rebuilt our military $2
well first of all it is really a beautiful place
well if you didn't understand honestly there's no way anybody could win because you'd believe them
well you know the president has lost in court
what
what a great group
what a group
what a group
what a job
what a run
what about all these other countries where that stuff is just flowing out
what about china
what about india
what about russia
what aoc has gotten away with all of that money that she used for her personal self with campaign finance is worse and nothing happens to them but it happens to you and it's not fair
what did we do
what do you mean
what do you want
what happened
what happens is that door opens up and the colonel told me he said 
what happens is they leave and then everyone leaves with them and she's still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd
what the hell
what the hell is going on
what the hell is this
what was i thinking
what we've done is incredible
what's your ideal
what's your problem
when all of their ludicrous hoaxes have been exposed as frauds these sinister fakers then tried to impeach you for daring to call out their own corruption
when i came in and was totally depleted
when i came into office a very prominent general told me because it looked like we could have a big conflict with someone said 
when i ran i thought it was rigged but this is crazy what's happening
when the so-called people that were teaching how to fight turn the gun on them and shoot
where
where far more than 3000 people died saying 
where is he
where is hunter
where the hell is he
where turkey is carrying out now a very tough campaign against the kurds get them out
where's hunter
where's hunter
where's scott

who's going to want to speak to your president
why

with your help we will win back the house we will keep the senate and we will win the white house
with your help your devotion your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning winning

you look around the world and we have no choice unfortunately
you mean like coming into the united states maybe
you plant it
you plant it
you practice
you practice
you remember that
you remember that tape
you should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods and that's what you have the right to do right now
you take them
you understand
you will hear sounds like you've never heard
you would never have seen anything like what they want to do
you'll see
you're going to have your plan the way you want it
you're not going to believe this
you're ready
you've all seen it
you've called me donald for 35 years
you've called me donald for 35 years
you've got a bad mayor
you've got a bad mayor
you've got to change your mayor
$150 billion they got $150 billion for nothing
12 billion sonny purdue secretary of agriculture
197 to nothing right at the house
2
2 grossly incompetent people
2000 troops
21 but they were like 33 phones
25000 people walking down the street looters anarchists agitators burning down stores throwing things at police
287
33000 emails
47 days from now we're going to win wisconsin and we're going to win four more years in the white house
48 people shot six died
5 trillion buys you some good stuff especially when we have the finest scientific minds and military minds in the world
5 trillion in the us military including major contracts to build new warships that helped save the historic shipyard in marinette
8 billion in cash how about that
91 percent approval rating
a federal judgeship is a big deal
a horrible number there shouldn't have been one person that died
a little bit heavier
a lot of bad things happened
a lot of people don't react well under pressure
a lot of personality a lot of personality
a lot of the times i'd say to the anchor i'd say 
a number that would not be sustainable would not be acceptable
a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs and a limitless future for all americans
actually the people i like the best are the people that are less successful because it makes you feel so powerful
admiral no thank you
again if they would have called us early it would have been over
ah come on fellows
ah fortunately we had that whole thing essentially recorded
all in democratic run super liberal run cities
all of a sudden i'd become president of the united states
all right
all right
and a man who just got elected and he's from an area that i know very well we did very well we got our big big fat beautiful contract that produced lots of jobs
and a very big hello wisconsin we've been very good together
and biden would demolish all of those games and we've done similar things in other states
and bottom line we worked very hard lots of calls to lots of different states lots of people
and cnn is going 
and despite all that we've all gone through
and early in the night they said 
and even bernie is going 
and everybody raises their hands like fast
and guess what the third was the year before that
and he cheered the rise of china as a very positive development for america and the world i don't think so
and he reacted very well under pressure
and he sold out on trade
and he wants to wipe out 180 million private healthcare plans that people love 180 million plans
and he was a great gentleman
and he went before congress and he repeated my conversation except that he made it all up
and he's fighting a very bad establishment in washington
and her fantastic family too
and his own man who headed it up swine flu it's h1n1 swine flu
and hopefully that's going to be us
and i did
and i didn't even make these numbers up
and i don't mean they're off by a little bit they're off by 20 percent 25 percent
and i got sleepy joe biden trying to tell me how to do it
and i love sports right
and i met some people and canada finally did it to them like they did it to everybody else
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i said the good news about that is the gloves are off
and i support you a 100% you know that
and i think our task force has been incredible
and i think they have an ulterior motive
and i will say sean duffy said 
and i will tell you this they're not so happy now but at least they got a deal but you're happy
and i'm thrilled to be with thousands of loyal hard-working american patriots
and if people have 401ks if you want to have your 401k go down like to depression levels i think you should vote for sleepy joe because he's going to raise your interest
and if you have to go that route make sure they have it counted
and in all fairness with no president they paid us nothing
and it could be very very soon
and it turned out to be a great deal but i don't talk about it the same way
and it was a terrible thing
and it was not only possible we have many countries that are joining us very soon
and it's about time you were happy
and it's all jobs but you got hit particularly hard
and just hope they remember you every once in a while
and just in conclusion and i hate concluding with you because i like you
and let me tell you he's not old
and mike pence has done a great job
and most importantly they will put many judges on the united states supreme court
and nancy pelosi was all set
and nasa is now the hottest space center anywhere in the world
and now all of a sudden he's going to do what he never did in 47 years
and now biden's telling us how to do what we're doing so well on what other countries are calling me and congratulating me on the incredible job
and now he's your congressman
and now i hear him talking he should have followed me
and now i'm going to make it even stronger
and now they call me up 
and now they caught weissmann and all these guys cleaning their phones because they were under investigation and they cleaned their phones
and now they're building what was that like $6 billion worth of ships
and now you can't do that anymore
and one of the largest cattle orders in the history of our country because they're very smart
and one of the things oh what they did the worst of all was the soldiers
and one of them who's been a great warrior and he's doing a fantastic job i just saw you on television by the way bryan
and our stock market is for the most part at a new high
and perhaps no issue have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration
and prime time was 25 years ago
and she looks at me 
and that has to do with the second amendment
and that really got me going the little specialty milk specialty products a small portion but you know what that was it
and that was in prime time
and that's the deal he made with bernie sanders opening the flood gates to terror afflicted nations
and that's true
and that's what we want we want this great country to win
and that's when it all came down
and that's why i say the gloves are off because when they do that that's worse than what i'm going to talk to you about that's big 10
and the audience isn't quite like this
and the family is all over the place all over the country
and the man that headed up the swine flu i won't use his name because i'd like to have him have a nice evening because i can't imagine the democrats are thrilled
and the penalty has to be very fast very swift and very very severe
and the president of mexico has been terrific
and their beauties
and then all of a sudden they're in foreclosure proceedings and they've never done that before
and then all of a sudden they're looking like it's going to be very close
and then go home to the mansion and have a good time
and then i said 
and then it would have been easy for me but they gave us so much
and then the virus came in we closed it down we saved millions and millions of lives
and then they said 
and then they said it was eight times quid pro quo
and then they tried to stop them from even getting into the hospital
and then you saw what he said the other day under a harris-biden administration
and they better be careful those paper ballots you talk about a bad thing just get out and vote get out and vote
and they called the election for her and they can't find the ballots
and they gave her a victory and they cant find that the guy that is against her who did very well even though he's even more progressive i don't even know what she is
and they know it's trouble
and they lose their farm
and they make a lot of money selling the product to us same product
and they raised a tariffs massively they made it impossible
and they tried like hell to get some judges approved but it didn't work
and they'll have one two three or four whoever is the next president
and they're going to get rid of your social security because everything's going to come collapsing down
and they've created their space forces i said 
and they've taken advantage of our country for many many years
and together with the incredible people of wisconsin we will make america wealthy again
and we also took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murder of american troops and many many troops and many people all over the world
and we don't have to talk about it too much nor do i really want to talk about it
and we had a lot of help from your congressman on that one because a lot of people wanted that contract
and we have a great congressional candidate derrick van orden
and we have a great deal
and we have everybody looking for that creep that did it
and we just happened to have a couple tonight
and we pay our deep respects to prime minister abe of japan a great friend of all of ours a great friend of mine
and we were challenged by some people on the left
and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions always you have a pledge
and we will ban sanctuary cities which are deadly
and we will end our reliance on china once and for all
and we will live by the timeless works of our national motto in god we trust
and we're winning the fight and we're winning this election
and we've got a lot of rich guys sending them up too
and what made it worse is she said the same thing
and when i took over three and a half years ago there was grass growing in the runways you know that it was closed down it was a mess
and yet look what they do to general flynn and some of these people that did nothing
and you are nominated for the nobel peace prize you're the united states no but think of this
and you haven't seen anything yet
and you haven't seen that lately
and you know this i don't have to go into it but i saved the suburbs
and you remember with me they thought because of my personality they said 
and you think that was easy
and you won't have a second amendment
and you're going to have your best year economically next year it's all heading in that direction despite the pandemic given to us by china
and you're not going to have them make your product in mexico or canada send it over here with no tariff with no tax
and you've been a tremendous beneficiary of what i've done and i have to because you've been with me you've supported me and we've had great victories together all victories so i want to thank you
and your 401k's and your stocks and jobs will go down in flames
and your former congressman who i hope is making a lot of money in the private sector because he deserves it especially his wife rachel deserves it she's just fantastic
anytime you know the world champion at anything but especially that and i'll never forget
anyway great job
as far as i'm concerned i think she's fantastic
as long as i'm here you'll always have a second amendment
as president i'll always support the heroes of law enforcement and i'll fight to ensure that criminals who murder police officers do indeed get the death penalty
as soon as i heard that anybody said they were born for this that doesn't play well
as soon as i said it they were against the wall
at no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties two visions two philosophies or two agendas for the future than these two parties you got law and order on one side and you have chaos on the other
automatically anything we do they just take the reverse
because i don't know if you know it the single greatest year wisconsin has ever had was last year
because i saw what russia was doing and i saw what china was doing
because i see how hard our president has to work
because if you do don't listen to the rest of this
because nobody loves our soldiers like i do and they made up a phony deal
because people don't want that
because they love my stance on trade because i know trade and i was telling him much more so than even bernie
because what he's done to the black population of this country was a terrible thing
because you can't afford it and biden's looking around 
been after that money for a long time
before i got here what was happening with japan
beto crazy beto
biden
biden also opposed my plan to ban europe i saw what was happening in france and spain and italy and highly infected we banned europe
biden didn't agree he didn't they just told him what's happening
biden has called to end cash bail you know that right for vicious criminals
biden has vowed to remove those tariffs and allow china to resume its pillaging
biden opposes school choice and vowed to ban charter schools
biden opposes the death penalty for cop killers or mass murderers
biden pledged to abolish american oil american jail clean coal natural gas
biden says he wants to protect black lives but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of african american citizens
biden was willing to sacrifice american lives on the altar of open borders
biden will hand the left wing mob the keys to your kids' classroom
biden's supported every disasterous global sellout for half a century including a nafta china
brought back our manufacturing jobs rebuilt the awesome power of the u
bryan steil; young handsome but a warrior
burn down the buildings
but all of them everybody
but bernie is right on that subject that other countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off on trade
but biden would absolutely eradicate your state's economy
but biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists
but by comparison to other countries and by almost all metrics we've done an incredible job including the job of helping the world with ventilators and all of the things that we built
but by that time it was too late because they had already embarrassed themselves by doing it
but he can't do it
but he was taking a legend's place so it's never easy to replace a legend
but he's a good man
but he's in charge of the second amendment
but i couldn't do that because i know how crooked she is
but i especially want to thank a football legend he was great
but i know a lot of very successful people very very successful
but i predict the sanders people are going to vote for us like they did the last time
but i put it and think of this by the end of the term we'll have approximately 300 brand new great federal judges court of appeals judges 300 which is a record 300
but i said that if they close they close
but i saw some farmers and this was like the straw that broke the camel's back
but i want to congratulate the big 10 conference on yesterday's announcement that the fall season will start very soon
but i want to just say they do disinformation they make up a phony story and then they go with it
but if you have a family that you love and you have a small business or farm or whatever they were being put out of business
but if you think that biden opposed the mission to take out of osama bin laden he was against it
but if you want to really see a great job take new york and some of these other democrat run states out of it
but if you're a president and you get nominated then two days later you get nominated did you know this a second time for a different deal
but it did and we saved a lot of lives
but it was all because of specialty milk and the way you were taken advantage of by canada
but kamala harris and 13 members of biden's staff urged their supporters to donate to a fund to bail out rioters take them out of jail get them out of jail as soon as possible
but last week they had the largest order of corn
but last week they know how i feel and they're very smart
but let me tell you they are very tough
but many times world champion
but my people didn't buy that because my people went out to vote
but no we have enough politics
but over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world
but people don't want to see it and the ratings are down
but remember everybody said i was going to be in war
but remember that every night you'd have these horror stories about the va
but remember this in politics it's always the thing that they say first that's what they're going to do
but right now i will tell you iran if we win iran will be calling us within the first week they're dying to make a deal
but that night remember they started off by saying 
but the anti police demonstrators they cheered and cheered when they saw this
but the rhetoric of biden and the radical left puts your law enforcement in serious danger
but the soldier story about standing over their graves you know the one i'm talking about then they do a commercial
but then they took an ad saying i'm the one i didn't want it
but there's tremendous pressure on your second amendment
but these are players that have a shot at the nfl
but they don't want to play that too often
but this guy probably or possibly beat her
but this was the final straw
but unlike joe who lets you down when he'd never even came back to milwaukee to apologize or just to pay respects i came to wisconsin and i've been here a lot since since we started this a lot
but walls are never obsolete neither are wheels
but we actually catch them take their name release them say 
but we called them and the reason is that they took an ad
but we can't let that happen
but we did a great job in kenosha
but we got it for wisconsin remember that
but we have built and created weapons the likes of which this world has never seen before
but we have three vaccines right now they're in the final stage clinical trials
but we want to get that we want to take care of it
but you know what
but you know what
but you take a few of the states out and you'll really see numbers
buy american
by far i would say but she picked him and hopefully that's going to be history it's not going to matter and that is no way for a woman to become the first president that's for sure
by the way i was endorsed by new york's finest and we're with them all the way
by the way if we had two people die they would have said he did a terrible job
by the way that will destroy your country you do know that
can you believe it
can you imagine
carolyn maloney
check it out maybe you can do something
china never paid us 25 cents not 25 cents with obama and biden
climb over each other's face you can climb right over their face
come back in 1000 years from now
come back in about four years for your court case
could be it's amazing how all of a sudden they hate the vaccine
could you still do it today
cows they don't want cattle they don't want cows
crazy nancy crazy as a bedbug
crazy pocahontas she's a nasty one though isn't she
crooked hillary that was a real piece of work
darling i love that guy but he's not going to win
darling i'm sorry you can't watch tonight
derrick good luck
did anybody ever hear of her
did anybody hear herschel walker that night
did anyone know this the farmers
did everybody get that money right
did they withdraw that one

did you hear that
did you know that
did you know that

do you think we're going to win
does anybody know what that is
does everybody know bryan steil
does everybody like charter schools
does that include the boston bomber
does that mean everybody
don't worry about it
don't worry i won't say anything bad about you cnn
donald trump has won the state of wisconsin
earlier this year i kept my promise to american workers when we ended the nafta nightmare and signed the brand new us-mexico-canada agreement into law
earlier today i took a historic stand against the hateful lies being fed to america's youth the parents know all about it
elizabeth warren decided not to drop out and when she stayed
environmental
especially for the farmers because it's that kind of a business
everybody likes choice
everybody said 
everybody wants law and order
everybody was nice and loose
everything everything that they wanted but i made one mistake
everything that he said he's now denying
fixed the disastrous trade deals they have been the worst ever
for 47 years joe biden crushed the dreams of wisconsin workers and enriched foreign countries
for years you had a president who apologized for america
fox and friends and plenty of other places right
frankly you wouldn't have a second amendment if i didn't get elected it would have been obliterated
from china thank you very much
from green bay how the packers doing so far
from milwaukee to madison from oshkosh to la crosse
further reduced health insurance premiums or the costs of prescription drugs which are coming down now
gdp down 27%
get it done right
get up and leave the table
give me a break
give me a break and i guess under that theory this big guy is next he's next
give or take a little tiny bit but 300
glenn thank you very much friend
good got to be careful when you do that a lot of times you don't like people too much
good richard
got more televisions in any plane in history
hard to believe we're going so fast the numbers have been incredible
he actually said 
he broke a lot of bones
he called for police and he calls them all the time the enemy
he can come with us
he can maybe run for governor or maybe do something sean duffy
he can stay here
he can't possibly win
he championed every special interest biden every special interest
he could be that piece of wood that was left in the ground
he couldn't get elected dog catcher right now in utah
he couldn't tell you why
he doesn't have a chance because the polls he's down 10 he's down 20 he's down 50 points darling
he even opposed sending the national guard into a place called kenosha did you ever hear of kenosha
he gave us 142 openings
he goes remember
he had no idea
he left 142 judges for the republicans
he left us 142 openings
he loves his country and he loves his state glenn grothman
he made very good deals against the united states but he's somebody that's going to be missed
he never got up to walk
he opposed the killing of soleimani
he oversaw the rise of isis what a mistake
he said
he said
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said no fracking right
he said the fracking i told you that but we're not going to let him get away
he said well he broke his back numerous times
he says they're the enemy and he just thinks it's terrible
he sold out like almost nobody ever before
he supported them all biden surrendered your jobs to china and you know that
he think it's terrible
he voted for the iraq war he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military
he wanted all prisoners to have
he wants to take the tariffs off that are paying us tens of billions of dollars a year
he wants to take them off
he was a great president right
he was great
he was some player
he was under a lot of pressure and he ended up winning by like 18 points
he went very very strong 
he would destroy your social security totally destroy it and destroy protections for preexisting conditions
he'd say 
he'll be in war the first week
he'll be raising your interest rates
he's a great gentleman
he's a human being
he's a real beauty
he's a tough negotiator i'll tell you that
he's always been a weak person
he's an animal
he's another beauty mitt romney
he's been there for 47 years he didn't do a thing
he's doing a great job
he's end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by over 700 percent
he's fantastic because i know he's coming back into government in some form
he's going to be leaving office very soon like in a matter of a day
he's got to do this and that and everything that i'm doing everything that we're doing
he's great and he loves this state
he's just a great american but do you remember his last debate
he's not a human being
he's not an animal
he's off and i have no problem saying it anymore when i watch the disinformation because this is not disinformation
he's off okay
he's shot
he's shot
he's xenophobic
here we go again
here we sit is that air force one yes that's air force one
hey don let's go
hey don let's go to dinner
hey look at what happened in iraq look at what happened with isis look at what happened with our military look at what happened with our vets
hillary clinton deleted as opposed to depleted she depleted them too; but she deleted 33000 emails
hillary would have been in war with north korea
his people his representatives because biden doesn't know he's alive let's not kid ourselves
history
hope that we never have to use them
how about giving me a coat
how about that
how about that
how about that
how about that did we do a good job
how can i do okay i saved the suburbs
how dangerous is it
how did that happen
how do you get elected
how do you think china would feel about this election
how does that apply
how many were there
how much harder was it to go up the tree than down
how stupid these people are
how they don't do it how they don't do it in some other places when you look at what's going on with chicago right
how was it was
hundreds of thousands of more americans would have died from the plague
i also took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's rampant theft of wisconsin jobs
i always defend him on this
i always say never go out with a successful person
i announced that we're launching a new pro-american lesson plan for students called 1776 commission
i call it the china virus
i called him an animal the other night
i can now call him grossly incompetent the man is incompetent
i can't do it anymore
i can't watch
i can't watch me
i checked they're doing it in wisconsin too
i could only be supportive
i did great with women
i don't care
i don't know if somebody said you just doing okay in the suburbs
i don't know what it is but i think if i owned a beauty parlor i had a customer i'm not sure i'd be turning her in
i don't know why the hell i like wisconsin but for some reason
i don't like it
i don't like these polls but four down
i don't talk about it like i used to i talked about it it was great
i don't think he's going to make it
i don't think she's progressive
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
i feel that way so strongly so do you
i fought like hell to keep them into the china deal and he wants to remove them
i gave it to a lot of people but i gave most of it by far to the us treasury
i gave you $28 billion right
i got impeached over a perfect phone call of congratulations to the president of ukraine who i never met before
i got rid of the prosecutor here's the billion right
i had friends
i have every farmer calling up saying please do me a favor
i have friends that are 85 89 92 95 and they're 100%
i hear good things derrick
i hear very good things
i hear you're fantastic
i hope that team does well
i just say it here hopefully we're never going to experience it but that's what's going to happen
i just see he's up there tonight getting softball questions from anderson cooper
i keep saying joe joe it's h1n1 right
i kept my promise recognized the capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
i knew i like you
i know this state very well
i like the old days
i like you
i liked that better
i lost all my friends because it's respect for the office let's face it
i lost all my friends because of this position
i love it very much
i mean i'm watching what they're doing with biden where he's using teleprompters 
i mean obama got it like in his first couple of weeks and nobody knew why he got it including him remember
i mean that's all you heard your whole life right
i never met him
i never said under a pence trump administration he said 
i never talked about that on the campaign i never even thought about it
i probably wouldn't be here if it weren't for that it was one of the big things one of the big reasons i decided to say to my great wife our first lady let's go have some fun
i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and we achieve the first breakthrough in the middle east peace; and you saw that two days ago uae bahrain israel nobody thought it was even possible
i remember
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said to her a long time ago i've got more indian blood in me than you do and i have none i have none
i saved it and made it stronger
i saved the us auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job killing catastrophe the trans-pacific partnership
i saw john kerry on television the other day
i say 
i say 
i say 
i say that and i say it's strongly
i see dollars going right up but they need a good place to launch
i see what he puts with and i turned her in
i see what they put him through
i should have gotten nominated seven times because we did a lot of other things but these are for two different deals and not one mention was made on the evening news
i should have said 
i should have said 
i stopped a lot of death and i did it like easy it wasn't hard for me
i tell it to them
i think bill barr's doing an excellent job i have to tell you
i think i'm going to call her in
i think she's whatever she has to be
i think that takes courage right
i think there's no brand to me that's gone up more than the us coast guard
i think they might be inclined to go for sleepy joe
i think this
i think we're doing great all over the republican cities we're fair
i thought it was a great thing
i thought we taught that lesson
i thought we taught them that lesson two years ago
i took a small portion of it i added it up 16 and 12 28 and i said $28 billion is going to the farmers
i took over a military that was totally depleted like
i want it open
i want to see that law
i want to thank president obama
i wanted it closed
i wanted to go in the first night we would have stopped it immediately but it was a great outcome as was in minnesota
i was a little surprised i'm a little surprised
i was asking about it
i was born for this
i was hoping that she'd win so we could go after her because i think kamala is not as smart but she's a little bit less vicious
i was just endorsed two days ago by chicago police
i was there two months ago
i was very happy but i'm very happy in this life
i was very happy in my other life
i wasn't perfect i said i'll see how it works out
i watch him though he's denying all this up
i wish we did it a little sooner but we finally got your governor's okay
i'd like to say pass a law one year in jail you started burning flags we put you in jail for a year
i'd probably do it to them too so i can't complain
i'd say far less than an hour i'd say a half hour
i'll go
i'll meet you at a restaurant in new york
i'll see you later
i'll take a pass
i'm a little surprised you let it happen actually but we're going to get rid of it
i'm glad i did but these are very deceptive deceiving sick people
i'm hurting myself by telling this story
i'm not a believer in the polls but i believe that one
i'm running for the reelection and a very important reelection to bring jobs in factories back and that's a continuation
i'm the one that said they shouldn't close
i'm watching this biden and he's got his sign in front 
i've been saying that for like 20 years right
i've known her for 25 years
if a woman is going to become the first president of the united states it can't be her
if biden wins the mob wins
if biden wins the rioters anarchists arsonists and flag burners they win and we're not into flag burners
if biden wins very simple china wins
if he gets in they're going to raise interest rates
if he's elected his radical supporters won't just be causing mayhem on the streets they'll be running the department of justice department of homeland security the department of education
if i didn't terminate that stupid deal first of all you wouldn't have the deal in the middle east and all these countries are joining it's happening fast
if it were up to sleepy joe biden bin ladin and soleimani would be alive
if joe biden gets in the radical left will shut down wisconsin's timber production for environmental reasons
if that virus hadn't hit us and it did and it hit the whole world but if it hadn't hit us we would have numbers the likes of which nobody thought were even remotely possible
if they did their job i wouldn't have run
if we had 100 people die if we had 1000 no matter what we do
if we had insisted and listened to joe and insisted on doing what so many other people said doing which is 
if you are of that side of the plate of that ideology and you had a president that left you 142 federal judgeships i don't think you'd rate him as doing a good job
if you look at all of the problems that we have you look at crime even somebody brought it up today we're doing a great job relative to other countries on the coronavirus
if you love your family that's a big deal
if you're going to do something at least know him a little bit right
in 2017 i signed a historic executive order making government policy to buy american and hire american
in fact many farmers in this group because you got to love trump
in fact sometimes i have to turn it off
in fact that's why i'm here because if it was good i wouldn't have run
in one case they paid billions and billions of dollars a month to the us
in other words another one disinformation
in the first three years we lifted six point six million people out of poverty the largest poverty reduction of any president in the history of our country
in the history of our country
in the other case he said 
in the second term i will provide school choice to every parent in america
including one who attempted to murder a police officer a man who was accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl
instead of standing up for america joe biden and the democrats they condemn america and war is always waged on our great law enforcement
instead we watched her concession speech
is he entitled to a vote
is he good
isis would still be on the rampage and china would now be the dominant power in the world and there not even close i will tell you
it doesn't have tariffs
it drove her crazy
it got hit hard
it has to do with right to life it has to do with so many different things that will turn your world upside down
it is not possible
it is not possible
it just drives them crazy
it should have been stopped at china
it was a disaster
it was a horrible job we had no idea what we were doing it was a disaster
it was a perfect conversation
it was easy going up
it was just announced that in 2019 before the virus came in from china we grew median income by a record of $4400 in just one year achieving the highest median income in u
it was ruining farms
it was tough but we have a really good secure border
it wasn't easy let me tell you
it would have been a nasty one too
it would have been torn up
it's 2000 miles long but these are minor details
it's a disgrace that they can do it
it's a great business but it's day to day
it's a great deal but we feel differently about it don't we
it's a little bit like what we did with the statues
it's a little late
it's a terrible thing that's going on
it's a very unfair deal but as the expression goes we won i don't know how the hell we did it
it's always a difficult situation but it was
it's called disinformation
it's different
it's easier to remember because h comes before n
it's going to end up being maybe your most important or certainly one of your most important because that's where it's at in terms of defense in terms of offense
it's just none of your business but we were loose
it's much better
it's not beautiful
it's not been too positive
it's one of the reasons i made the great deal with canada and mexico but canada because they were taking advantage of you so badly on your dairy products
it's really a vote for the american dream instead of letting washington change us
it's so sad to see it and that would happen
it's sort of a natural thing to do but we did a good thing
it's sort of an amazing thing
it's the biggest enthusiasm gap he's got no enthusiasm
it's the craziest thing
it's time you got a big break
it's unbelievable and yet they want wind and wind also is very it's very hard to store the electricity from wind
it's us
it's very simple
it's very warm in new york and very warm in washington it was hot actually
joe biden devoted his entire career to offshoring wisconsin jobs outsourcing your factories throwing open your borders dragging us into endless ridiculous foreign wars and surrendering your children's future to china
joe biden is a weak person
joe biden's agenda is made in china
joe called it n1h1
joe tell me
kamala harris that's another great beauty kamala harris that's a beauty
kamala was right up there
kim jong-un remember we're supposed to be in a war with him what happened to the war
kosovo
last one was 75 years ago
last week china ordered and you have to understand i view china differently now than i did six months ago we made a great trade deal but i view it differently because i don't know if i can ever view it the same
last weekend two los angeles sheriff's deputies were ambushed and shot at point blank range
let me ask you a question
let me call up the commissioner
let me see that law i want to see that law
let them do it
let's give it a shot
let's go have dinner and then we'll come home and watch his concession speech
let's go have some fun
let's say you're doing not only here let's say texas right he's against oil he's against god and he's against guns
like 22 different names
like space force that's a big deal
listen you're against fracking but now you have to be in favor of fracking because you lucked out
look at that the red lights are on
look what we did at minneapolis
loosen up
loves all the states actually
marinette
maybe it would have been totally knocked out
maybe we'll build it double thick or we'll go twice as high
maybe you can improve it it's not bad though
meaning if you assault a copy or anybody else you're right back on the street the next day
meaning maybe nine hundred years ago there was a little action going on
military and obliterated the isis caliphate
minorities want law and order
more happy because nobody has produced in three and a half years the first three and a half years nobody has done what we have been able to do nobody
most of them have already arrived
move it up move it up i can't see i can't see
mr
my administration will be by their side through every step
my agenda is made in the usa
my attitude was that and i've learned this a long time ago by having them we keep ourselves out of war as opposed to bringing ourselves in war
my plan is to arrest the domestic terrorists
nice evening a little problem there were a lot of buildings in the background that were burning down to the ground as reporters said 
nice new ones all built in the usa beautiful ones
no but he was the world champion tree climber
no but the wall is great
no but there was a very old law
no but was that one of the greatest evenings ever remember
no everybody wants law and order
no guns no religion no energy no oil remember that
no it seems to be good
no it's a sick deal going on there
no mike is great
no more airplane trips
no no walls always work
no no we're gone we pulled all the troops out of syria
no one has been more wrong more often than sleepy joe biden
no other administration certainly the last one because the last one was grossly incompetent
no she's a great owner
no that's terrible
no this is a peaceful protest
no we're going in
no we're pulling the troops we're almost out of iraq
nobody gets left any openings
nobody gets left one opening
nobody thought that was possible
nobody's ever done more more than anybody else has ever done to keep our family farms in the family
not have it
not me us
not only china not only the $28 billion farmers
not too good it didn't work out too well
now all of a sudden in years where he was never considered smart but now he's really not considered smart
now biden wants to surrender our country to the violent left-wing mob
now he's against religion
now he's liking the police much more
now i don't want to give them any ideas because they'll search all over the country for a vet who's unhappy
now i don't want to speak too loud but i did put out on social media the other day that if they hit us in any way any form written instructions already done we're going to hit them 1000 times harder than we've ever hit them before
now it's president trump
now they shouldn't have allowed it to go on for 11 days they should have called us immediately but do you remember that beautiful night
now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for the state of wisconsin
obama was not able to do it he wasn't able to come close
oh
oh boy
oh by american
oh he was a great president
oh he's not going to do well with women
oh i hope your team does well after all that
oh man let's get into a different question
oh maybe i'll do something with social security
oh no it does have tariffs
oh of course we looked at it
oh okay well you're the senator from hawaii that's right the beautiful island of hawaii
oh thank you so much
oh that's a problem
oh they all raise their hand
oh this is so beautiful
okay
okay larry
okay let's rip it down and build a new one
okay you got it
on november 3rd wisconsin will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we will allow biden and the democrats to impose a four trillion dollar tax hike ban american energy confiscate your guns which is what they want to do
one night it was a fake impeachment
one thing they have is probably everything opens on november 4th you understand that
or their ratings are going to continue to go down like they did last weekend down 27%
our coast guard has been fantastic by the way
our record is like 222 and three so i don't like to have a loss
our vets are better taken care of now than they've ever been in the history of our country but never forget they are coming after me because i am fighting for you
over the last three and a half years we've secured america's borders
people don't realize canada is one of the toughest negotiators and they treated your state and this country very unfairly until i came along very very unfairly
philadelphia florida texas everybody ohio
pocahontas
pocahontas you know pocahontas
portland i'd love to go there
president i appreciate it
president sir would you like to get together sometime
president xi of china is not shot
proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
putin is not shot
qasem soleimani is dead he's dead bad guy bad guy very bad guy
rachel she's been our friend from day one i think from day one
really good
remember
remember bernie sanders
remember first instinct that's where they're going and he has no choice because he has to because again i was going to say the radical left hates him because they think he deceived them because they agreed on that manifesto and that manifesto is seriously a leftist dream and he agreed from the green new deal getting rid of your planes
remember he put beto in charge of his gun policy right
remember he repeated it
remember her when they explained to her that planes are out cows are out
remember i tell this story all the time
remember our incompetent negotiator john kerry
remember that
remember the crazy senator from hawaii
remember the question up there he's standing up 
remember we were going to be in war with north korea
remember we were supposed to be guarding the border between syria and turkey
remember when beto went out he said 
remember when china said we're not going to do anything we're not buying
remember when she was saying 
rich guys like rockets i don't know they like rocket boom
right glen right
right sean
right you know
s
s
sadly
say no and walk
schumer and pelosi see it they have no idea what the deal is 
sean do you think we're going to win here
sean duffy
sean right
serbia
she accused him of metoo she accused him of everything
she came out she was at like 14 15 in the polls and she started going down down down it never stopped
she can do my hair anytime
she choked and she went for a blood test
she decided to make a nice little stop-in at the beauty parlor how did that work out
she loved doing it she from day one but she thought it was what schiff said
she said 
she was terrible at the debates
she was the worst of everybody
she's a terrible person
she's accused him of everything under the book the busing remember the busing scandal
she's another great one
she's crazy as a bedbug
she's done a great job and very popular
she's for us
shifty schiff right
shut down the economy destroy the suburbs
sir 12 billion the year before last and last year was 16 total of 28 billion
sir it's 49 degrees
sir it's very dangerous
sir you're going to win so easy
sleepy joe biden is wholly owned and controlled by the far left
so big tax cuts big regulation cuts
so get your friends get your family get your neighbors get your coworkers get everybody and get out and vote november 3rd
so hopefully they will just come and we'll make a deal and they'll go back to being a rich country let them go back and be rich but they cannot have a nuclear weapon
so i got nominated twice for the nobel peace prize that's a big deal i don't know
so i have to rely on people in congress to be my friends
so i made one mistake and i tell this to these guys because they were great warriors for me the congressmen
so i said brilliantly he'll never pick her because she was too terrible to him
so if you go home and you want to watch television because president trump is on and you want to watch one of his very brilliant state of the union addresses if the wind isn't blowing the husband looks at the wife says 
so if you're a president right
so instead of saying we're not going to do business which would have been okay with me
so it's great that we're getting them new ships
so let me just ask you just a very innocent question
so let's see what happens with all of that stuff
so on the statutes they were knocking them down three or four months ago
so rightfully he's not too happy
so tens of billions of dollars billions and billions i gave it to the farmers
so the funny thing a lot of people don't know because the fake news doesn't write about it
so the nobel peace prize
so then i said 
so they could have dropped it but they said 
so they said they'd build a bridge from the mainland to hawaii
so we did many things
so we have another great one and he's really a friend of mine and he's been solid
so we sent in a question 
so we'll defeat the virus and next year will be truly i think from an economic standpoint and from other standpoints maybe the best year of all
so we're not doing that stuff anymore
so we're not going to have that anymore
so what about the boston bomber
somebody else would have said well let's not do business
sonny how much have they been hit for targeted for
sonny said 
sorry you can't watch tonight
starting next week my administration is committing an additional you've been asking for this for a long time $13 billion in relief to help farmers recover from the china virus including wisconsin's incredible dairy cranberry and ginseng farmers who got hurt badly
take a nice sauna and then if you want after you recover you come out and you go and you do your thing whatever the thing may be
thank you

thank you tom
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you very much china right

thank you you win
that deal was so bad that obama made
that he was a racist
that is a beautiful site right behind me isn't it
that one wasn't good
that was a disaster
that was a tough one wasn't it
that was adam schiff
that was donald trump in those days
that was terrible right
that was the end of the settle problem
that was where the danger
that would be so easy
that would have really hit you
that would rip our country apart
that's a beautiful site
that's a big deal
that's a big thing
that's a great company but it was having a hard time
that's a lot of hate
that's a lot of people back there
that's a tough combination in texas
that's a very dangerous position to be in
that's all right
that's another one we're down to about 2000 troops did you know that sean
that's enough
that's in the history of our country
that's more money than this country could earn in 1000 years to do it right
that's not a good sign though right
that's not bad
that's right thank you that's what i said
that's right the space force
that's serious hate right
that's true
that's what happened
that's what happens
the air force right
the anchor said to me like 
the army the navy the air force the marines coast guard; and now we have the space force
the big windmills i always say the greatest graveyard in the world for birds just walk under a windmill
the computers they come up with a brand new computer it's genius 12 days later it's obsolete
the democrat party's war on cops has already led to surging homicides in democrat controlled cities
the democrats were totally in favor of the wall until i said when i came in 
the fact is and somebody said it on the other side an opponent said whether you like it or not trump actually did more as president than he promised during the campaign
the first lady did great ivanka did great
the guy's getting beaten on every point i say 
the hard part was coming down because if he missed that was where the danger was right
the largest order of soybeans in the history of our country
the likes of which this country has never seen before
the one who treated sleepy joe the worst was kamala
the only enthusiasm is for the people that want to beat us they want to beat me
the only two things i know for sure you're going to have a wheel and you're going to have a wall
the other guy's jumping around mike is just sitting there we love america we're going to lower your taxes
the owner of the beauty parlor is a maga lady she loves trump
the owner turned nancy in
the panhandle we love the panhandle
the reason is because everybody else all of the radical left candidates up there they couldn't get too far left so joe agreed
the red cities are doing great
the second best year that wisconsin has ever had was the year before
the usmca is a great deal and i'm very honored to have done it
the votes come in they have no idea they can't count them
the wheel
the wheel and the wall you can go back
the wind is not blowing
the wind is not blowing
then he gets the nomination now they're all angry
then pelosi would say 
then they would have insisted that we build it i could have saved two years of litigation
then we waited a little while
then you're supposed to bring them to a court like perry mason right
there's a tremendous disincentive it's called like let's not do it
there's a young man about four years old up front i think he could give the answer
there's fraud
there's just something wrong with joe
there's missing ballots
there's some bad apples in that whole deal
these endless wars and we had to fight other things but we've done a great job but we're acting like a police force over there
these people are terrible
these rallies look at this rally
these windmills are knocking them out of the sky all day long
they all did they did great
they are a disaster together
they ask him 
they cannot
they choke they choke
they clean their phone so you don't have any of the information but that's a big problem for them i would imagine
they cleaned their criminals yeah that's criminal it's criminal they're criminals
they did a check
they did damage we should have gone in
they don't ask me questions like that
they don't have to worry about that anymore
they don't have too much money for terror anymore it's actually amazing do you notice what's going on
they don't want cows bad for the ozone layer
they gave her an election they can't even find the ballots
they go into these storms
they go into these storms
they got to find him
they got to find him
they had something called specialty milk
they have a shot at pro-football
they have a woman in new york who is a terrible congresswoman you know that
they have car in a parking it's the weirdest thing i've ever seen
they have cars in a parking lot
they have everything on air force one that's the great thing
they have to have it
they have to sign a document
they just had another election today fellows where it's a disaster
they keep saying 
they know nothing about the deal
they love wind too right
they made enough money for a long time
they make them so bad that you lose all your appetite you lose all your spirit they take your guts out and you don't go and vote and your wife looks at you and says 
they make up a totally phony story
they never thought anybody would do that to them
they never thought it was possible and rebate clauses
they pay us now tens of billions of dollars
they refuse to say it
they refuse to say it and they hate to say it
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they said 
they say 
they say 
they say don't use that term it's too tough
they stopped it for their country but it came out to us to europe to the rest of the world 188 countries
they talk and talk and talk they're criminals
they thought hillary was going to win so they didn't push it
they thought they were going to put pressure on us
they took an ad saying i was against football
they took over a chunk of the city and when they heard we were going in it's like 
they tried to take over that business too along with all of them it was just massive and horrible what they did
they used to be loose they used to be great
they want prisoners to vote too they wanted to
they want to all join
they went very fast very quick at levels that nobody else could have ever achieved
they were actually accusing him of plagiarism
they were incredible actually
they won't open them
they won't open these blue states they will not open your churches
they would have done that it's a different world i guess but it's sort of coming back to the way we have to have it because we're for law and order
they'd have to go and borrow the money to pay the estate tax the death tax
they'd have to go out and sell the farm they'd have to go out and get partnerships they'd have to go out and borrow money from banks
they'd say 
they'll probably possibly call you back and if they don't that's okay too
they're called suppression polls
they're coming after me i said 
they're going to raise your taxes you will have a depression
they've been guarding their own borders with different names for a thousand years
they've been killing each other for hundreds of years
they've been trying to get that sean for what 30 years they've been trying to get that right
they've got televisions in closets on floors on ceiling
they've started already and we worked very hard on that
they've taken the authority away from our police our great police
they've taken their authority and their dignity away
think of it
think of it
think of it; army navy air force marine
this election we are doing well
this guy did the swine flu right it was a catastrophe
this is a great deal
this is fact
this is like a dream for china
this is not a good question
this is not a good story
this is not what people want and she comes in through the backdoor this would not be what people want especially because it's her
this is the greatest economy in the history of the world
this is the most important election in the history of our country
this is what we're dealing with
this is what we're dealing with
this isn't fair
this will be a very short evening for donald trump
those ships are all coming in
through our historic relief programs we saved more than 1 million wisconsin jobs and 87000 wisconsin businesses that's not too bad
to do it the way they want would cost $100 trillion
to this day he has no idea why he got it
tonight we're also praying for everyone in the path of hurricane sally
totally independent
try going to court sometime on a civil case and when you go before the judge he'll say 
unbelievable the bravery
under a harris-biden administration
under my administration we've achieved the most secure border in american history
under the green new deal you basically can't fly in an airplane
veterans satisfaction 91 percent the highest score we've ever received

when the fake impeachment happened it was a total fake what did we finish up with the republicans
when the wisconsin timber industry was threatened i imposed tariffs on dumped foreign timber and subsidized products saving many many timber jobs in your state
when they thought it couldn't be done they said 
when you look at the opposition when you look at how unfair it is and these guys know very well you look at how unfair it is it's pretty damn good but we have a lot of support
when you look at what's going on with portland those are just anarchists
when you pick somebody you pick somebody that's hot that's going in the right direction right

you don't have to wear masks you don't have to do anything
you don't see that anymore

you have a bad crop all of a sudden you can't pay interest on a loan to pay your state tax right
you have my total endorsement all right
you have to look around for it
you haven't noticed remember years ago every story every night the nightly news you'd always have horrible stories about the va you don't see it anymore

you know they have the wonderful oh canada we love to hear the song right
you know they were destroying our suburbs you know that right
you know we got it back right
you know we're in afghanistan we're pulling the troops you know that we're coming back we're almost finished
you know what a big deal first time in 75 years it's a new one
you know what catch and release is
you know what else works
you know what he's been doing
you know what helps so as you know for weeks before the election she was four up crooked hillary four up four up four up i kept saying 
you know what she said 
you know what we have enough politics right
you now have a great deal and you're not going to have your companies leaving for mexico anymore or canada
you really think so
you see it
you see them all they come out every day
you see what's going up
you see what's happening
you take a look at china's entry into the world trade organization and tpp
you talk about a good football player
you think that was easy that was not easy our great congressman over here that was not easy
you were targeted
you will have a depression
you will see more dead birds than you will ever imagine what's happening including eagles
you'd got to be sick to even think it okay
you'll have horrible healthcare

a lot of things for iowa but every week we seem to be going up in iowa because they're campaigning in iowa
a man who was with me right from the beginning
a man who's a friend of mine who was the greatest mayor in the history of new york city
a nation's first duty must always be to its own citizens it's own
above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together
after years and years of building up other countries we are finally building up our country standing up for our jobs our workers and standing up for our dignity
alex azar our secretary do rerun it well and sort of say 
all of the really the most expensive parts
all right we'll see what happens
all the news that is not fit to print
all the news the fake failing new york times
all you have to do is say china how you doing
amazing
america is winning again and america is respected again respected like never before
america is working again
and again china's devaluing their currency
and all made in the usa just so you know
and as part of my trade deal with china it's been very important
and at the center of america's drug crisis is the border crisis
and by the way the biggest beneficiary you know who have been great
and by the way the wall is being built
and by the way they've been changing and charging tariffs on us for years
and by the way you know where i was
and even though we had fake witch hunts on our back and all the other things that we had to go through we have taken this big beautiful ship and it's being turned around very quickly
and finally we said 
and he said 
and i also said though you know i hear all these rich guys for some reason they love space
and i came in
and i didn't really see it
and i had corey i had hope i had just a couple of people
and i hope to god we never have to use it
and i know a lot of new york's finest
and i said of course he's more popular
and i saw some fake polls put out by the fake news media and it said that i'm tied with three of the other candidates the democrats i'm tied in new hampshire
and i think they're having a big impact
and i want to thank manchester and new hampshire they're very special
and in fact if i was the most popular i'm not doing my job right
and in the case of the virginia governor he's having a rough rough time
and it was 306 to 223 remember
and it was ronna
and it's about one thing
and it's about the fate of your country
and it's almost completely rebuilt
and just three months ago we also recognized the golan heights as being a part of and protected by israel
and let me tell you if for some reason i wouldn't have won the election these markets would have crashed
and my biggest fan is secretary general stoltenberg from nato
and now we have a group of socialists or communists could be
and now we have a lot of car companies coming into michigan and we have a lot of great farming events happening really big in wisconsin
and one of our great friends was a veteran who's been with me in new hampshire
and our nation was weakened at home and disrespected abroad
and our public awareness campaign about the terrible suffering that drugs inflict has already reached 58% of all young americans
and president xi said he's going to do it
and sir i went into the vet
and so far he has not come through but i think he will
and someday soon american astronauts will plant the stars and stripes on the surface of mars
and that's exactly what we've done
and that's what you are
and the democrats don't want to fix the loopholes or asylum
and then i met with the police officers and fire departments and all the people that do
and then on election night she said 
and then we protect them
and then when i won his father got on and i said 
and then you're going to vote for somebody else
and there's a possibility we'll use both
and these judges will apply the law as written including we appointed two great supreme court justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh
and they also want to make a deal
and they are great people
and they come down and they save all of the propellants
and they immediately changed it after spending like a million dollars
and they looked down upon the hardworking citizens who truly make our country run
and they pay us rent
and they showed up and they voted like nobody's seen before
and they're really very tough ads
and this from forever five decades
and this was one of the richest nations in the world
and to help patients with life threatening illnesses we also pass something i'm so proud of 44 years they couldn't get it passed right to try
and today the deputy editor of the new york times was demoted
and together we are making america wealthy again
and ultimately their devaluations are going to hurt them very badly
and we are making america great again
and we could fill it up four times at least
and we had a campaign manager named ronna mcdaniel and ronna wouldn't stop
and we have all the time in the world right
and we have incredible things going on in pennsylvania
and we should reduce our taxes and many other things with all of that money that we're talking about
and we won michigan
and we won michigan and we won wisconsin
and we won wisconsin and they said 
and we're going to have some fun in the state of new hampshire
and we're running it better
and we're talking to them very seriously
and with your help your devotion and your drive
and yet with all that you see we've had one of the best years of crime prevention that we've ever had
and you can't really go by my election
and you have to criminalize in china the making of fentanyl
and you just seem to have a bigger problem
and you know what
and you must never forget the 2020 election right around the corner
another man who's here tonight is the world's tallest campaign manager
anyway thank you very much both for being here
are we sure that we're in new hampshire
are you going to support him
are you ready
are you ready
are you sure
as long as i'm president america will never bow to a foreign nation like we were for so many years
as we restore our prosperity we are also restoring public safety
barriers tariffs taxes and we let them come in
because of the trump economy i'll bet he sold it for a big big fat beautiful profit
because the greatest thing we can do is not get people started on drugs right
because they're fake news
because until a couple of days ago and that'll catch up very quickly we have no choice
because we are all americans
before the election our factories were closing
believe it or not you didn't have the right to go in and price your drugs
beto is like gone
big crowds and it really is keep america great because we have these socialists want to take it away from us
blue collar workers
build the wall
build the wall
build the wall
build the wall
build the wall
build the wall
build the wall
but actually you know what
but all of that ended the day that i took the oath of office the american people are in charge of their country again
but as a result of these efforts last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in 31 years
but at the very moment when our country should be coming together to enjoy these wonderful blessings the radical democrats are trying to tear america apart
but corey lewandowski loves your state loves new hampshire
but do we give up
but do we give up make america great for keep america great
but don't worry
but everything we had it was depleted
but i appreciate that story
but i don't know i think sleepy joe may be able to limp across the finish line
but i just want to thank you all
but i said 
but i used to complain i'd go there and i'd say 
but i was always complaining that our car business is being stolen
but i went to michigan and my opponent was told that the republicans no way you can win michigan or wisconsin that you just can't
but i'm not going to go into their plan because as far as i'm concerned the green new deal is a beautiful thing
but in my first week in office i proudly withdrew the united states from that job-destroying catastrophe
but in this administration we have something those sell-out politicians could only dream of
but it's going to happen and i think it's going to actually be in the end actually better
but it's hard to get off
but it's in good hands
but people have to remember however that there is a mental illness problem that has to be dealt with
but they're not far away right
but they're not looking for that
but think of it in 10 years the aids epidemic will be eradicated
but today they announced that they're going to cut way back on his appearances because he is such a disaster they're going to have fewer appearances
but we also let the private sector put up rockets
but we got rid of the worst part of it
but we had a woman in michigan and i said 
but we still have much work to do
but we're also doing it and nasa has some of the greatest plans we've ever had
but we're also doing it ourselves
but we're doing ads on television and papers about how bad it is for children so they can see it
but we're really we are working so hard on advertising and promotions to tell young kids children how bad drugs are how dangerous they are how horrible they are how they destroy your brain how they do so many bad things
but what a place that is it will be open in a little more than a year but i have to make a decision
but what about the bad ones
but when the wall street journal comes out and they say 
but when you listen to the fake news look at how many there are
but within a very short period of time it will be the lowest rate in the history of our country
but you have no choice but to vote for me because your 401ks down the tubes
but you know what
but you know what
by the way i never said china was going to be easy but it's not tough and they want to make a deal
by the way the european union is worse than china just smaller
can you believe it
can you believe it
can you imagine this
cash cash cash
china wants to make a deal and i will tell you iran wants to make a deal because the sanctions are not good for them
chris your father was so tough
chuck
come make your product in america
come make your product in new hampshire
could never have happened could never have happened
democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities
democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion and socialism
democrats want open borders they don't mind crime
did you ever think you were going to hear that
did you ever think you were going to hear that
did you make a lot of money on the house
do i make it great
do we give up make america great again for a new slogan because look our country is doing great
do we give up the greatest theme phrase logo whatever you want to call it in the history of politics risky for a brand new one because make america great again
do you give up the greatest slogan in the history of politics in our country
doctor in the house
doctor in the house
does anybody want to pay 95% taxes
doesn't it make sense
doing good
earlier this month the us government officially labeled china for the first time ever a currency manipulator another promise kept
election after election politicians came to your state pretending to have the courage to stand up for the american worker then they went to washington and let other countries push them around and special interests buy them off and steal your jobs and take your companies
even though i didn't get sworn in until january 20th but they refused to do that
even though many people that come into our country are wonderful people they're are still coming in illegally
ever
every day my presidency we will never forget that we are americans and the future belongs to us
every democrat candidate also wants to give illegal immigrants free welfare
every leading democrat has pledged abolish the american oil coal and natural gas industries that are fueling our economic boom
every major democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would raid medicare and destroy the private health insurance plans of millions of american families that they love
every vow that politicians made was broken every hope was dashed and every promise turned into a total betrayal of new hampshire and of our country
everybody benefits
everything's going to be down the tubes so whether you love me or hate me you got to vote for me
except ours was far more sophisticated and we had a man that did an incredible job
first thing i've ever heard him say that i agreed with he's got no choice
for decades and decades the permanent politicians in washington pursued the very opposite
for that to be allowed to happen is a disgrace
for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
four years eight years or in one case more than that cut more than anybody
get him out of here please
globalism
globalism enriches foreign countries at our expense
go and talk to china
go home start exercising
go to china take off the tariffs make a deal
go to europe
good
got a bigger problem than all of us
got great poll numbers
got low rates it's a good time to refinance your house by the way
got to think about those things
great deal
great guy
great job
great job
great job brad
great president
great story
great time
hard to believe isn't that
has anyone ever seen anything like the water being thrown on new york's finest
have to
have you ever seen
he didn't build a wall
he got no choice
he had his operation
he hasn't made up his mind yet but he would be fantastic
he held some kind of a meeting for me and he has a nice house but literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people showed up and they destroyed his house
he is an unbelievable talent
he just said it
he loves this state
he never liked me i never liked him
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said 
he said i'm working to make sure you get elected
he said sir he's a great veteran
he said until president trump came along we were going boom
he was a great great mayor
he was a great president
he was a great president
he was great
he was the first one that talked about us possibly winning the whole big ballgame
he went from being the toughest critic to the best there is
he'd always be here
he'd come drive me crazy
he'd say 
he's a nazi
he's a nazi
he's been a great governor chris sununu with a great father too great father
he's been to every rally i ever gave a new hampshire right from the beginning
he's been with me from the beginning
he's from this state
he's going to do a job if he does do it so we'll see what happens
he's not demanding that they pay for their protection that we provide
he's not doing that
he's now our campaign manager and he's one of the tallest human beings i've ever seen
he's so tough
he's tough and he's smart and i'm hearing he's thinking about running for the senate from new hampshire
hey we run it well
hey who knows it better than you
his house has never been the same
his house is a disaster now
his name is brad parscale and he is fantastic
hispanic americans and asian americans have all reached their lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our county
how about another time
how about that
how come
how dare he say that
how we doing brad
i appreciate
i appreciate it
i called prime minister modi
i can tell you in new york they closed so many of them and they let really seriously mentally ill people out on the streets and you see plenty of them today even today
i did the pocahontas thing
i didn't even understand it myself but i was named man of the year
i do
i don't even want to describe them
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know if he's running
i don't know what happened to them but i came to office and i had 138 judges that were not appointed by president obama
i don't know where you are
i don't know why going to lose michigan
i don't like you
i don't mind any of them
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think that's going to happen
i don't think that's going to happen folks
i don't think we're ready to make a deal
i don't want it to change
i got nato to pay an extra hundred billion dollars
i got so tired of looking at him
i guess it's something you go back and you talk to your family you talk to your wife and you make a decision
i had a businessman the other day one of the most successful guys in the country
i had him on for month after month
i had something today
i haven't liked you but to be honest with you mr
i hit her really hard and it looked like she was down and out but that was too long ago
i hope the buyer didn't hear what i just said about your house
i just think it's going to be a tremendous four years
i know we're not supposed to win the great state of michigan but i think we're going to win michigan
i left and i said 
i lose all the cards we take off the tariffs
i love our country
i love this because it's free
i mean i actually had something today
i mean i know it's not true 'cause i know you too well
i mean it's sort of obvious right
i mean literally it's gone and we build a brand new 30 foot steel and concrete wall and the fake media said 
i never saw this before six months ago but they're doing it now more and more
i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said let them send the rockets up
i said that you have to show them
i say 
i see him in the white house
i should've waited
i sort of hope it's him
i started speaking at one o'clock in the morning
i think he'd be tough to beat
i think it's great
i think we can honestly say it's the greatest slogan in the history of politics in america
i told my guys at nasa you know nasa when we took it over it was exhausted
i used to go around new hampshire more than any state and you'd say 
i used to say it all the time
i want to thank you all
i was going to keep it actually
i was in new hampshire
i wasn't even political
i will let them have it like you've never heard before
i will never ever let you down that i can tell you
i will tell you this we now have a great attorney general
i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal
i wonder if big pharma had something to do with that
i would never let that happen again and chris will never let that happen again
i'd go for years
i'll tell you one thing he'll go into washington and he's going to have you in mind
i'm doing that
i'm just telling you
i'm not blaming them but they gave me the right to go out and get a great cancer surgeon
i'm not holding it against you because it was not your fault
i'm not the president of the the world
i'm saying you can win sir
i'm so proud of that
i'm sorry folks you have to pay
i'm sure none of you knew who that vote was
i'm telling you you can win
i'm the president of the united states of america
i've also taken the toughest ever action to stand up to china's chronic trade abuses
i've done this before
i've never liked him never liked him
i've never seen anything like it
if companies don't want to pay a tariff i have one simple solution
if he was a great president how come he left me 138 judges to appoint when everybody says that's the single most important thing a president of the united states has to do
if i ever did that it would be over
if i would have said that during the campaign those people back there would have been headlines headlines
if they never start
in fact five or six years before i even thought about running for whatever reason they named me man of the year in michigan
in fact he had a meeting at his house
in fact if you look at the straits where we're having all of the problems you look at the straits number one they're not touching our ships they're not playing with our ships
in his case the baby is born and then he goes to talk to the mother
in louisiana an lng plant $10 billion
in other words 17000 criminal aliens were released by these cities directly into us communities
in other words just a short while before the election
in other words you have a picture you have to go up
including and we hope to god we never have do use it
incredible
india
india tariffs us probably higher than any nation anywhere in the world
individual mandate individual mandate where you have the privilege of buying the right not to have to pay for expensive insurance
is it a possibility we'll use both
is that better
is there a doctor please
is there anything better than a trump rally
isn't that beautiful
it all left the state of michigan
it belongs to us
it brings it back to fairness and it makes it very hard for our companies to leave our countries go to mexico or canada
it can be revived
it can be rewritten right
it doesn't matter to me folks
it just it breaks your heart what's happened
it makes it almost impossible
it treats us horribly
it was called the trans-pacific partnership
it was disgraceful
it was like this
it was six o'clock the day before the election
it was taken away from us but we should've
it wasn't like 
it went crazy
it will be revived and it can be revived very easily and very quickly
it would have been a disaster
it would have been in shambles
it would've gutted would've destroyed the industry
it wouldn't seem that way but it is one of the best years because those gentlemen that we just saw the law enforcement they do a great job
it'd be wonderful to make a deal
it's a big decision
it's a great dream
it's about you
it's about your family
it's about your future
it's all about her
it's almost like what are we watching is this fiction
it's also time for democrats to join with us to protect the sacred integrity of our elections by supporting voter id voter identification
it's america first
it's beautiful
it's being built
it's called america first
it's called strength and commitment
it's doing great
it's going to be very very hard for companies to do that
it's hard to get off
it's in good hands
it's incredible
it's like elizabeth warren
it's lousy healthcare
it's never been the same
it's never going to happen to us because we will never ever be a socialist nation
it's nice when you don't have to look for anybody
it's not the gun that pulls the trigger
it's pretty tough
it's real easy
it's real easy
it's really we it's not me
it's the best place anywhere on earth
it's the person holding the gun
it's up to us
it's worse than china
just applaud like crazy for the one you want to use for this campaign
kamala is falling
keep america great
last year alone sanctuary cities declined more than 17000 requests from federal authorities to hand over criminal aliens already in their custody
let me have first make america great again then keep america great right
let us know
let's give it a shot
let's vote for elizabeth pocahontas warren
let's vote for somebody else
like somebody said he just sold it
look at this
make america great again
make america great again right
man he did a job in the first year
many nations were except for seven
many nations weren't paying what they were supposed to be paying so we're supposed to protect them
many of them a lot of jobs
many of us come from there
maybe one a little bit less
maybe we can get representative omar from minnesota to open it up but i don't think so
me i don't care about their campaign contributions
mexico now has 32% of our car business
millions and millions of people
more than seven million americans have been lifted off of food stamps
mr
much better
my administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you
my administration is fighting to expand opportunity for citizens of every background and every race religion color and creed
nazi
neither does anybody
never
new hampshire
new hampshire house republican leader dick hinch
new hampshire lost one in four manufacturing jobs following nafta and china's entrance into the organization two of the worst deals ever in the history of our world not just our country
new hampshire senate republican leader chuck morse
new hampshire was taken away
new york was crime infested
no
no it's a beautiful thing
no no take the tariffs
no tariff
no wonder you sold it

now they use it
now they use it like on a regular basis
now we've rebuilt our military like never before
now what do we do ready

oh gee he's a horrible person
oh great
oh the fake news
oh this guy kills me
oh wait a minute
oh we need to protect them
oh we never thought of that
okay you ready
one of the most powerful promises i made to the people of this state was to confront the opioid and drug epidemic
one of them has a rally he's got 100 people
one people one family and one glorious nation under god
one wants open borders
only with fixed poles does that happen
opioid
or do we run it badly and have everybody upset
our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in 51 years
our auto industry is coming back so strong
our equipment was tired
our great farmers have been so incredible because they've been targeted by china and frankly they've been targeted for a long time including by incompetent politicians that have run this country for a long time
our jobs were vanishing
our military was totally depleted
our movement is built on love and it is and we love our family
our people weren't tired
our people weren't tired though
our shared republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs pro family pro growth and 100% pro american
our united states armed forces
over time you'll see
past leaders followed the terrible advice of these editorial boards that are frankly totally inexperienced in business i guess and our industries were utterly decimated
pennsylvania would have never happened

that didn't work out too well
that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred the gift of god
that primary came around and remember what happened during the primary
that slogan wasn't too good
that they don't want to do but we need voter id
that was an easy one
that was my one rule that i had to have
that was taken away
that was years before i did this
that you're difference
that'll happen even more so in 2020
that's a good thing
that's about it
that's an incredible thing
that's good
that's great
that's just renovation
that's mexico and canada
that's no good health insurance

that's what it's got going
that's why
the army corps of engineers is doing a great job
the baby is now born wrapped as he said and then they decide whether or not to execute the baby
the big problem
the brave this beautiful strong proud and free future
the crowd was just they want to see things happen in our country
the democrat party has never been farther outside the mainstream
the department of justice has prosecuted more than 3000 defendants in opioids related cases
the doctor talks to the mother
the fact is the leaders that were in my position they didn't do a damn thing
the fake news
the fake news will hit me on that
the fake news would get us but we don't let them get us and it is fake
the first person that i put on on the campaign he was driving me wild
the forgotten men and women of america will never ever be forgotten again
the greatest political movement in the history of our country
the individual mandate is gone
the job that she has done is incredible
the last administration with sleepy joe and obama tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated worse than nafta worse than wto
the lowest ever
the markets went up thousands of points
the most unpopular part of obamacare and we almost have obamacare gone
the non-unions benefit
the only decline in 51 years
the only thing i remember is the first night i went out after i heard it and i said see it's all about her
the opponent went there with barack obama and michelle obama and she went there much earlier
the republican party is the party of freedom
the runways and the grounds had all weeds growing through the cracks in the concrete
the same with another man our campaign manager
the small donors
the steel industry is back
the tariffs are working and they're eating the tariffs by the way
the tariffs were ridiculous what they do to us in europe
the taxes are really unfair

the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world
the united states right now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world
the usmca will create countless jobs for farmers and manufacturers all across the state
the wall is being built
the work they've done on aids is incredible
then i do it and she said 
then i leave and she said 
then they don't pay and i say 
there is one america we will support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
there was no wall it's lying on the ground
there we go
there's a possibility we'll use both 'cause i hate like hell to give up the one
there's never been a movement like this
there's no price increase
these are great great proud people

they didn't talk
they didn't talk
they do an incredible job our border agents
they don't disrespect us anymore folks

they don't have the power
they finally gave up and that was four years ago
they give me no credit

they were saying how sophisticated her campaign was
they were tired
they were very very late
they weren't paying
they would've been finished very quickly but i'm tired of paying for other nations anyway i have to be honest with you
they wouldn't have allowed him to frack
they're able to save it by bringing it back right to where it took off
they're all saying 
they're brutal
they're constantly saying 
they're doing a great job
they're going to cut way back on his appearances
they're hard hitting ads
they're losing millions of jobs
they're not coming in through merit
they're not far away

after years of building up other nations we are finally building up our nation and our jobs and we're taking care of our people
al has been bugging me
al he's been bugging me for years
all my life i've watched politicians
all over the country the sheriffs of florida all of texas all over the country ohio law enforcement's endorsing trump
all they have to look is at the biden harris
all this crap they come up with
all you have to do is how is china doing last year with my trade policy
also with us our state representatives al baldasaro and fred doucette
america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to plant its beautiful american flag
america will soon be thriving like never before and together with the people of new hampshire that have meant so much to me and i brought down opioid and i brought down drug problems for you by 19% and nobody even talks about it
and a weak guy named joe biden and he's weak he's weak as hell a weak guy like joe biden didn't even bring law and order up as a subject for discussion in the entire democrat national convention
and add to that coal and add to that shale
and al in honor of you we have passed va choice and va accountability al
and at this point when the economy is roaring back
and biden kept looking down
and by the way another big democrat hoax
and by the way mexico is paying for the wall
and by the way pat lynch is a great guy new york new york
and do you know where you buy your energy from
and everything else is going to follow
and general secretary stoltenberg said it can't be done
and hopefully we're at the end of this horrible china virus
and how about david muir of abc
and how about the questions asked by anderson cooper yesterday
and i did it all
and i talk about you a lot
and i'll tell you we're landing and there are thousands of people along the runways and i said 
and i'm the only president in 51 years last year drug prices went down a little not much but they went down the first time in 51 years
and i'm very good at predicting this
and if i did tonight's speech there i would have been criticized by being slightly radical
and it was rapid
and it's not just ukraine and it's not just china
and it's the wall that border security wanted so badly
and merrimack to manchester we will fight for every job every family and every neighborhood
and not a single american who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator not one
and now china is trying to just hug and kiss joe biden
and now that the wall is almost complete it'll be soon complete
and now the other day joe biden came up with a plan to impose a blanket shutdown
and now they're all going to be coming in
and our country is going to change
and our numbers on the border are the best they've ever been
and rand paul was in big trouble last night he's a good guy he's a friend of mine and that shouldn't happen to anybody
and right now we have just on two of your markets as you know s&p and nasdaq you're at new records
and that wasn't remember this that wasn't friendly protesters
and that's going to be almost everybody
and that's happened before
and that's what we're dealing with
and that's what's happening all over where you have democrat-run cities
and the dc police are good but the mayor gave bad instructions last night that should have never been allowed to happen
and the dems don't want it back for political reasons
and the mayor should be ashamed of herself for that kind of a display of incompetence because that's what's happening in portland
and then i had to go back to work
and then i went back to work and we've done an incredible job in every aspect of running government but i also had to start campaigning a little bit again and i did
and then our people walk out and these are people from all over the world they walk including congress by the way they walk out and they get accosted they get abused they get spit on
and then they got into the wto and a lot of bad things happened
and then they put in a floor
and then we banned europe very early because i saw what was going on really in italy and spain and france
and these incredible people from all over the country all over the world that were there last night they walked out to a bunch of thugs
and they said 
and they were right
and they're really acting as police
and they're saying that president trump shut it down
and they've swung like nobody's ever seen them swing before
and those are great people but they've been treated very badly
and today it was announced that joe biden is coming out of the basement
and together we are taking back our country
and we don't take the beautiful word god out of our pledge of allegiance do we
and we had the best year we've ever had
and we had to do it
and we have deported 20000 gang members and 500000 criminal aliens
and we have to defeat them on november 3rd
and we're looking at the whole situation in dc and tonight they have a lot of people gathering let's see how that works out
and yet we're moving our trips out
and you do you have a great governor
and you heard me say last night nato i got $130 billion from them first time going up to $400 billion a year from nato countries by saying 
and you know we give washington dc a lot of money to run it but they don't do a good job of running it
and you know why
and you look at this the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since april
and you still have
and you're about to hit another new record
and you're against the oil stuff too
anderson cooper
another big hoax
another few days we send in the national guard it was over within an hour
are we winning lou
are you crazy
are you having a good time corey
be careful
because governor cuomo will not let a pipeline go across the tip of new york state so that oil and gas of which we have plenty can come
because his whole thing on oil no fracking no this no that
because i agree with bernie sanders but my trade policies are much tougher than his and i'm able to do it
because i've seen you at rallies before
because if that happened to a republican in particular
because it's not just a one sided equation
because look you have one major party controlling congress and they don't want to give me a wall
because of trade
because the poll numbers have totally swung
because they all admit that we're doing a great job
because we are finally putting america first
because you have a great governor and we don't have same day voting anymore
before the china virus came in before that china virus came in we had the best job numbers ever recorded the history of our country
before the virus we created an economic miracle and now we're doing it again
before they went into the wto china was flat lined
behind him over his shoulders the entire city is burning down
biden voted for the iraq war
big 10 get with it
buses poured up from massachusetts with a lot of people that weren't going to vote for trump and they poured up thousands and thousands of people came in on election day and then you had a senator running on the republican party who wasn't exactly the greatest for us but we have done so well here and we're going to have a big win
but he goes into china takes out $1
but he is a us senator walking outside and those four policemen should be brought over to the white house and we ought to give them a medal of some kind and we're going to do it
but here's what i don't get
but i want football back
but i'm thrilled to be back in the granite state with the true hard-working american patriots
but i've only been doing it for four years and i only won one race but now i have to win two
but instead my decision saved thousands and thousands of lives
but it happened to him
but now biden wants to do another blanket shutdown possibly that would decimate the economy and cause suicides drug overdoses alcohol abuse heart attacks joblessness
but now that it's built you never hear about the wall
but that's air force one
but the agitators will go from rioting in the streets to running the halls of government
but the poll numbers have swung
but the wall will soon be complete
but they stoke the flames
but they won't allow a pipeline
but they've swung
but we brought it down 19% and people are absolutely shocked
but we're having a good time doing it this way right
but who would have thought just who would have thought that the stock market is at record levels right now
but you know what we're going to do
by not allowing a pipeline to go through upper new york state and create a lot of jobs for them you have the highest energy prices in the united states by far
by not allowing a pipeline we're trying to do it through essentially eminent domain
by the way in case you had any questions
by the way it's not biden
by the way on november 4th regardless they'll be opening them up november 4th because they think that hurts the economy and that will hurt me but our numbers are going to be great
call him sometime
came from china
can i be honest with you
can you believe it
can you believe it
can you imagine giving that all up and starting again
cash

china's entry
co-chairman of my new hampshire campaign lou gargiulo
come on
congressional candidate matt mowers
could be very dangerous
could we have more money
cover that properly kaitlan
dana white today
democrats have no complaint about the rioters and the vandals marauding through our cities or mass unruly demonstrations but they don't believe law abiding citizens can go to a church together
demolish your suburbs
developers understand
did you enjoy it
did you ever really believe it
did you ever think we'd get va choice va accountability
did you hear the questions
did you know that
do we like dick
do we love our american flag
do you know how big that is
does anybody have any doubt
does anybody know
does she want to get on the list
don't forget i've only been doing this for four and a half years
donald trump has won the state of texas
earlier this year i kept my promise and replaced the nafta nightmare with a brand new us-mexico-canada agreement
every time i do it they turn off their camera
everything was wall wall
except all those jobs went to south korea
expensive complex
favored nations could drop at 50 60 or 70%
first china's stole our jobs plundered our intellectual property and unleashed the virus
first time they've done it
for years and years and decades flat lined
from portsmouth to dixville from concord to keene
get it from the military get it from everything

great great people
great guy
great guy
great people
great steve
hard to produce
has nothing to do with anything
has nothing to do with george floyd
have you ever heard of these words
he always figures they always want to get that word in there
he could not believe it
he didn't care about anything else but the vets
he didn't have the same energy in the speech that he usually has
he even used somewhere along the line the word racist
he got thrown out of the armed services
he just met me
he opposed a mission to take out osama bin laden
he opposed the killing of soleimani
he oversaw the rise of isis and he cheered the rise of china as a positive development for america and for the world
he said if trump was president that wouldn't have happened and they're right that would not have happened
he said that 
he shouldn't have used the white house
he supported nafta
he wanted the vets
he'd be willing to do another blanket
he'd either be in very bad shape or dead and that would include his wife if those policemen didn't happen to be there
he's a big vet
he's a nice guy right
he's actually a nice guy
he's actually my biggest fan and nobody ever calls him for a quote
he's been a friend of mine
he's been a good guy for a long time
he's been here for a long time
he's done so many things
he's going to be out in 10 days
he's going to start 10 days
he's here
he's in another country right now probably ripping off another country
he's interviewed me a lot over the years and i always got along with him but they were tough interviews
he's no games
he's not too old
he's not too old but 78 is okay but i do
he's the sharpest guy you'll ever meet
hello everybody
hello everybody
hello everybody
hey al have i taken care of the vets better than you even thought
hi
hi al
hi dick
hi lou
hi steve
hi steve
hillary clinton's deal along with biden
honestly he couldn't have cared less about anybody here except the vets but i did a good job right
how about her
how about his son
how about his son
how about those stories
how about you
how am i doing
how are you everybody
how come you didn't tell us about this
how do you get worse
how do you win texas
how soft were those
how soft were those questions
how was your breakfast sir
i also took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's pillaging and plundering of american jobs
i believe he's the worst candidate the slowest candidate
i can't even call it biden's america
i cannot imagine them getting any law enforcement endorsements
i could come up and say 
i could get off that beautiful plane that used to be black and white with a red stripe
i could say it
i don't believe he had the right to do it
i don't blame them
i don't forget
i don't have the courage to cancel new hampshire
i don't have to do this
i don't talk about my ass
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't want it
i don't want that
i ended the job killing paris climate accord
i ended the rule
i get off that beautiful plane
i go to dover and i greet these incredible families of soldiers that have been so sadly killed
i go to the hospital i go to walter reed medical center
i got to win new hampshire
i guarantee you that
i guarantee you that
i had a friend from keene a long time
i had to go back to work
i hear you're doing well
i hear you're doing well corky
i just saw it today because last night i was looking at this speech a little bit
i kept my promise recognized the true capital of israel and opened the us embassy in jerusalem
i know a friend from keene
i know how to get money
i know people in their 90s that are 100% sharp and good physically actually good physically
i know people that are 85 that are 88 92 bernie marcus home depot he's 92 years old
i know these guys so well
i love him on television
i love the people and you've been very good to me
i mean i gave a big speech last night
i mean in prime time he was the slowest candidate which was a long time ago
i mean spend it on
i mention cnn they're screaming turn the camera off
i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in the middle east in 25 years
i said 
i said 
i said bad
i said this you could bring george washington back as your presidential candidate
i see what they can do but soldiers so badly hurt
i signed it
i talk about new hampshire a lot because you had one of the proportionally worst problems of any country of any state in this incredible country
i think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter
i think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter
i think your great governor is here
i told him 
i told that to rand
i understood it
i used to say it about 2016
i view 10 days is like an eternity okay
i want debates too
i want debates too
i want football back
i want football back
i want football back and big 10 open
i want to leave
i want to see the first woman president also but i don't want to see a woman president get into that position the way she do it and she's not competent
i want to thank new hampshire
i want to thank new hampshire for all you've done for me
i was against the iraq war
i was listening once they said 
i was very excited
i will have lost to a low iq individual
i wish i were president you would had a different solution
i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal a disaster
i wonder what happened
i'll be so angry at new hampshire
i'll get it for her
i'll never speak to you again
i'll tell you why
i'm a developer
i'm going to leave because i've decided that i want to leave
i'm hearing we're going to have a great win
i'm leaving now but you have to vote for me because you have no choice
i'm now running in texas against a man who's against oil guns and god
i'm the one that wants it open
i'm the one that's been saying
i've been calling for football to be back including big 10
i've had congressmen come in
i've spent the last four years delivering for the african american community like nobody with the exception possibly of abraham lincoln has delivered before
if any of that stuff happened to me it would be brutal
if biden got in china would own the united states very quickly
if he said no he's out of here
if i did last night's speech here by now you would have all been walking out
if i'm reelected we will create 10 million jobs over the next 10 months and we'll do that easily
if it weren't for the china plague the number would be 25 or 30%
if somebody's terminally ill like in the case of your wife if somebody's terminally ill at least you have hope but it's beyond that because people have gone home
if that governor if that mayor would call and say 
if that happened with respect to my family i wouldn't be standing
if the democrat party wants to stand with anarchist criminals rioters looters and flag burners that's up to them
if they do please let me know and we'll have a little discussion
if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands of more americans would have died
if you ask them 
if you don't mind we kept the oil
if you go back six months before the plague flew in from china the plague the horrible plague this election was over
if you go back three years that would have been something that would have been impossible to even discuss
if you look at it it's generally older people
if you want to save democracy from the mob then you must vote to defeat an extremely poor candidate
incredible citizens like you the people of new hampshire helped build this country
instead of the number we have today 175000 we could have had 2 million today instead
is she a beauty
is she okay
is she okay
is that a correct statement
is there anybody
is there anybody in this place that enjoys burning the american flag
it sounds easy it wasn't but it was easy for me
it was a depleted mess
it was a disgrace
it was a disgrace
it was a disgrace that these people are representing the united states of america
it was a mess
it was a rapid swing
it was for president
it was for president but we did the largest tax cut in the history of our country
it was important
it was incredible
it was more than one in four
it would have been unacceptable unsustainable
it would have taken years
it's a big statement
it's a disgrace
it's a disgrace what's happening
it's already getting defeated
it's called right to try
it's crazy
it's crazy
it's half what it was
it's incredible
it's incredible
it's just a con game
it's not acceptable
it's not biden
it's one of those
it's pretty amazing actually
it's stopping them like never before
it's such a shame
it's the biggest thing and nobody even talks about it but i've already put it into effect
it's true
it's true
joe biden has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history
joe biden is running on the most extreme far left platform of any nominee in american history and of our foreign adversaries we're devising a plan to destroy the united states from within
joe biden is the puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to obliterate and destroy everything that you hold here including your second amendment which will have no chance
joe biden spent the last 47 years betraying the african american community
joe biden's agenda is made in china
joe don't you understand that
just in case you didn't know that
just look at joe biden supporters on the streets screaming and shouting at bystanders with unhinged manic rage
just looks and gives her the answer but he's done a fantastic job
just take a look
justice kavanaugh
keene new hampshire
ladies and gentlemen of new hampshire you have no choice
last night i got great reviews of the speech and all but some of the fakers back there they said 
last night it was my great honor to accept the republican nomination for president of the united states
let me see
let's get some more lawyers into the act
let's let them in
let's put him as the vice presidential candidate
like we used to do in the good old days before we owed trillions of dollars
literally they're not allowed to do their job but pay lynch he said the first time in history that they know of new york's finest have endorsed a candidate
live free or die
live free or die
look at portland
look at some of the numbers be announced by companies
look at what's going on in the great state of wisconsin
look i believe i have the honor of running against the worst candidate ever put up by the democratic party the worst
look if you like china you should vote for biden that i can tell you
lou are we winning
lou gargiulo
manchester we had some good memories in manchester
many many plane loads $1
many plane loads
mark meadows is here we're going to have to look at it because we're not going to let that happen to people that go to the white house to celebrate our country
matt thank you
mike pence did a great job
mohamed highly respected
mr
my agenda is made in america
my first week in office i withdrew the united states from the last administration's horrible stupid insane trans pacific partnership
never forget they are coming after me because i am fighting for you
new england has the highest energy costs in the united states
new hampshire lost one in four and i think much more than that manufacturing jobs following twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the wto
nice guy
no
no as soon as biden became vice president bad things happened with respect to a hunter
no not for the rich
no one will be safe in biden's america
no reason for it
nobody can believe i did it
nobody here
not too well
now all these things what we're doing with drugs we instituted a favored nations laws
now i will tell you two days ago we sent in the national guard
now their new line is they are trying to blame me and keep football shut down
now they want to raise taxes
now they're all saying 
now they're not going to win
now they're trying to impose those policies across the entire country
now we can sign a quick simple document
now we're opening it up and we're opening it up to record numbers despite the fact that the democrats are keeping their states shut down and hurting people that live in those states shut down as long as possible
now we're very low in afghanistan now in terms of numbers of troops
now you signed a document
oh boy that's a nice price
oh from before
oh how dare you
oh i see
oh really
oh these people
okay
older people that have heart conditions that have diabetes that have problems
on top of that i instituted rebates where the rebates go toward price reductions and back to the customer instead of to a middleman
one race i won but it was the president
open up your season big 10
or mars
other people don't like it
otherwise could you imagine if sleepy joe got in and medical prices and drug prices and everything had dropped but he said 
our allies have been ripping us big
our movement is about a brighter future for all americans of every race religion color and creed
over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing super power of the world that's happening already
over the past three months we've gained so many different if you look at retail numbers
pennsylvania
people forget
please have it changed
please quietly raise your hand
please send in the national guard
price transparency
primetime
protest is your ass
protesters
really great
really great new york's finest right
record levels
remember i came here
remember that
remember that
remember that kaitlan
remember the idiot from cnn he's standing there
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right to try
right to try
run in texas and other states you couldn't win
russia
second amendment
see actually actually chris who has always wanted to be his father but it never worked out because of a lack of talent
she couldn't get it before me
she left because she wouldn't have gotten any votes
she really is a special person
she was terrible
she's a special person
she's always looking for money 
she's not competent
she's one of the favorites
simultaneously with the closing
sir i've been doing this for 25 years and in 25 years i've only lost three races sir
sir we couldn't let them in
sixty seven days from now we're going to win the great state of new hampshire
sleepy joe i don't want it
so do i
so don't be surprised but they're not going to get there
so give me a break
so good
so he decided he's coming out and he's going to be out in 10 days
so i want to thank you governor
so i worked very hard on that for this state and for other states but this was a state that was so severely impacted with the drug problem
so i'm not going to work at all
so in conclusion i have to say this
so many people
so many people they used to travel all over the world to get a cure
so many people you saw some tragic situations some really great endorsements you saw everything
so new hampshire was the first state i won
so now they're talking about 
so sadly killed
so that's okay
so they're going crazy
so they're reversing it
so we sent they did a very effective job
so we will protect medicare and we will protect social security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions
so we're going to tiptoe around
so we're not supposed to go in unless we call it an insurrection but that's a big statement
steven
take a look at our retail numbers
tell me
tell me
ten days
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you al
thank you corey
thank you governor cuomo
thank you matt
thank you new york
thank you very much
that guy's been bugging me for years
that includes china which was having a very very bad year
that really hurt us because people sort of went back to some old ways because they don't want to be shut down any longer
that statistic is wrong
that wall is stopping them and it's stopping them like never before
that was a killer
that was an exciting evening
that was an exciting race but we don't talk about that anymore
that was from the heart
that was great
that was meant to hurt the united states
that was mine
that was the end of that problem
that wonderful young lady that was so incredible and spoke so well
that's a big percentage of the remaining time
that's a long time
that's all right he's much better off where he is
that's despite a pandemic that was probably sent in by china who the hell knows how it got here and all over the world because china does not want to see me win i can tell you that
that's despite phony witch hunts phony investigations a phony impeachment based on a phone call that was absolutely perfect
that's going to drop your prices 50 60 70%
that's like an eternity in trumpville
that's not a positive development
that's power
that's right
that's what we need is more lawyers
that's when i realized how powerful a president is in the united states
that's where they're coming from
the bad news is it goes into effect on january 1st
the biden agenda with big tax increases and big regulation increases would immediately kill everything
the candidate is donald trump
the doctors are so talented
the good news is the ratings aren't great
the levers they call it the levers of government
the mayor she doesn't run anything
the next president will be in my opinion responsible for two three four and maybe maybe even five us supreme court justices
the place was going to burn down
the puppet biden who's just controlled so strongly wants you to cancel weddings funerals and school but has no problem with thousands of so-called peaceful protesters cramming into your streets mugging people hurting people robbing stores looting stores burning down storefronts
the radical left will do anything to get power
the radical left's effort to divide everyone by race tears us apart
the reason they didn't fight back too much they don't want to lose their pension
the republican party and you i can see you
the republican party is the party of abraham lincoln
the republican party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep america safe and our law enforcement
the space force
the statistic is wrong far more than one in four
the thugs outside because the democratic mayor of washington dc it's another democrat that's not believing in law and order
the top 10 most dangerous cities in america are run by democrats and have been for decades
the wall will soon be completed
the wall's not getting done
their rights have been taken away from them
then i get it done
then she goes 
then the plague came in from china
then they say 
there is no limit to what we can achieve with four more years
there'll be crime all over your streets
there'll be released and this is despite the fact that the democrats are holding back michigan north carolina
there's not too many presidents that have done a job like we've done including keeping you out of wars bringing you home from the endless wars
these are big strong guys
these are friendly protesters right
these are just bad people troublemakers and they shouldn't be representing our country at important events and we've got to stop it
these are young strong guys
these people right here
they always turn off their camera
they are playing a suicide mission
they are playing a suicide mission if they want to raise your taxes
they couldn't even tell you
they did it last time
they did it on purpose
they did it twice
they did it twice
they didn't come to us
they didn't think i was going to get it done
they don't ask me questions like that
they don't even know who george floyd is
they don't have great ratings
they don't know that
they don't know who george floyd
they don't talk about it anymore
they don't talk about it anymore
they don't want to be shut down
they don't want to lose their job because we've become so politically correct everybody's afraid to do anything now but they did a good job
they don't want to talk about it
they got fire pouring out of their eyes
they have no idea
they have to be able to manage their affairs they get a lot of money
they it twice
they ought to get smart and that's what they ought to do
they promised 250000 jobs right
they put in a floor that's like an ice skating rink
they really like it because i've been telling people for years our country is being ripped off by china and many other countries including i hate to say it our allies
they said that couldn't be done
they should have stopped it and they did
they took some big beating
they totally swung
they want him so badly
they want to abolish american energy including all of the things i said before
they want to abolish cash bail and cut funding for law enforcement
they want to destroy your suburbs indoctrinate our children defund the police and try everything in the book to turn our cities so that they look more like portland oregon than what we're used to looking at
they want to eliminate america's borders in the middle of a pandemic suspend all deportations restore catch and release and expand horrible dangerous disgusting sanctuary cities
they want to end national security travel bands from jihadist nations very dangerous and increase refugee admissions by 700%
they want to end school choice and ban charter schools
they want to erase your borders confiscate your guns appoint radical left judges and prosecutors tear down our history
they want to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers
they want to keep it shut down
they want to keep them
they want to raise your taxes by $4 trillion
they were thugs
they were thugs
they would have done that to senator rand paul last night
they'd own it
they'll be just fine
they're acting as police
they're agitators
they're all saying we want ivanka
they're at records
they're back
they're destroying the livelihoods of innocent people and if biden wins which i honestly can't believe can happen
they're going to be raising everybody's taxes almost
they're literally at records
they're looters
they're not going to be affected by the virus
they're not protestors
they're paying for the wall
they're playing a big con game
they're rioters
they're saying for the rich
think of it
think of it
think of that
this election was over
this guy i met him
this is a friendly protest
this is for manchester because you know about flooring
this is in the bernie sanders crazy bernie you know crazy bernie
this is now at a new level

this is the one
this man if you look at what he's done we went into a deal the korea you know about the korea deal
this november each of you will vote in truly the most important election in the history of our country
this would be your president possibly
time goes by they forget
to bring opportunities to our inner cities i signed the groundbreaking criminal justice reform prison reform opportunity zones permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities
to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures we passed and hopefully anybody here doesn't need it
today the united states is the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth
today's democrat party is filled with hate
together we've spent the last four years cleaning up 47 years of biden disasters
tonight i'm in new hampshire and we can wing it
tonight we're honored to be joined by new hampshire house republican leader dick hinch
tremendous guy
tremendous help

wait till you see the numbers just before the election
wall
was that assad with their incredible daughter what happened
was that just compelling and incredible television but really that was an exciting a really good quality convention
we are all that stand between the american people and the left wing mob
we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
we are not going to let the radical left socialists or communists take our country
we are one movement one people one family and one nation under god
we blanket we shut down
we built the single greatest economy in the history of the world
we can cancel
we closed it down
we could take care of portland in 45 minutes 45 minutes
we did a good job for the vets
we did everything right
we did it right
we did the paycheck protection program where we saved more than 200000 jobs in new hampshire alone
we don't forget
we don't have same day
we don't talk about it
we eliminated the most job destroying regulations in the history of our country
we ended the catch and release stopped asylum fraud
we give you the greatest medicines even if they haven't been approved
we got to get her on the list

you can be fools and you can be fooled but that's where they're coming from
you can go out and you can have thousands of people marauding through the streets threatening other people beyond threatening kicking them in the face doing what they've done
you can go over at taxes and you can go over what we've done with the military
you can't go to church anymore
you could bring abraham lincoln
you couldn't win
you don't know what it is what happened
you got to do it
you got to do it
you had one of the worst problems of any of the states
you have a great governor
you have no idea
you have ships much of it from russia because governor cuomo new york won't allow a pipeline and they're desperate to have something happen in upper new york state
you have to see some of the results have been incredible
you have to vote for me because if you don't you'll be put in radical lefties
you haven't noticed on the wall
you heard all about and now we're producing ventilators
you know how many churches are closed in this country because of the democrats

you want debate
you were my first victory as i said but you are going to lead a nation to the most important victory and the most important election that we've ever had
you will go into a depression
you will go into a depression the likes of which this country has not seen since 1929 and who knows maybe worse than that
you'd have jobs all of the problems that it causes

you'll have peace in the middle east
you're going to new hampshire but sir we can cancel new hampshire because you had a big night
you're going to win this state sir
you're not going to have low income housing built in your suburbs anymore but nobody writes that because the fake news doesn't want to write that but everyone knows
you've been very good to me

you've seen it
your 401k's and your stocks when you have stocks would be obliterated

141 think about it
18%
2
2 it's really $2
2 trillion to rebuild the united states military as i said and i love saying it because we are funding for new hampshire the new hampshire army national guard readiness centers just a few miles from here in pembroke and in concord
28 times you can keep your doctor
5 trillion over a period of three years
a friend of mine another great leader and somebody that's going to be speaker of the house hopefully next year kevin mccarthy
a very simple mission remember
a wheel and a wall
a wheel and a wall
above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america
abraham lincoln
actually i think they're trying to take it away from bernie again
actually they get it better than we understand
african american youth unemployment is so important
after years of building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country
ah boy if we could get him to run for senate he would win so easily
al-baghdadi is dead
al-baghdadi is dead and we just took out the world's top terrorist qasem soleimani ending his evil reign of terror forever
all made in the usa
all they do is they looked at everybody for the last couple of months and they said 
also a woman that not too many people know
also a woman that not too many people know
although they think we're going to run much more than that you know that right
always will
amazing
america is thriving like never before
and a man with a very familiar last name greg pence the brother of mike
and african american poverty numbers have hit the lowest rate ever recorded
and all together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere in the world
and also with us our warrior senators the two people that wanted to be here
and as you know we've also confirmed two great new supreme court justices
and by the way our poll numbers with african americans with hispanic americans with asian americans the other side is getting a little nervous because they are like rocket ships
and by the way the virus they're working hard
and by the way you have a great governor chris sununu
and by the way you have to see
and dave bossie
and david and corey thank you also for being here
and david and corey thank you also for being here
and did don jr
and for the amount of money washington democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants we could rebuild the cities in america
and haley
and his father is a great guy
and i haven't done it for a while and i thought i'd do it tonight because you're on the eve of giving us an opponent and all of these people want open borders
and i listened
and i see next to them two warriors
and i see somebody two great people a great couple in the audience matt schlapp and mercedes schlapp
and i used to do this a lot and people couldn't get enough of it to be honest with you
and i will tell you that swamp is much worse than i thought when i was out here innocently campaigning
and in the senate other than romney we got 52 to nothing 52 to nothing
and it may even be better who knows
and it was very very close even though they did but this year we have a great governor governor sununu
and it wasn't even close and i want to thank our republican senators and our republican house members
and jared who's making deals that are so good for this country people have no idea what's happening
and kimberly thank you so much
and ladies and gentlemen of new hampshire the best is yet to come
and now you get prosecuted if you do what they did so it should be a lot different
and other senators said 
and representatives mark meadows
and thanks also to new hampshire senate republican leader chuck morse
and thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row
and the day after my address our good republicans in the united states senate voted to reject the outrageous partisan impeachment hoax and to issue a full complete and absolute total acquittal
and the fake news these guys will never report that
and the wall is being built
and then the number came out 225000
and there was a friend of ours chairman of the new hampshire republican party steve stepanek
and they mentioned little changes to it that's okay
and to me i view it differently
and tommy hicks
and we brought it down 18% but we have to do better
and we got rid of it saved a lot of money for a lot of people
and we got rid of the most unpopular thing in the healthcare world the individual mandate
and we have done more to secure the border of our country than any administration in history
and we have the biggest arenas in the country
and we hear that there could be because you have crossovers in primaries don't you
and we recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights been trying to do that for 52 years
and we want people to come into our country but they want to come in through merit and we want them to come in legally right
and we're going to run twice and that's going to be it
and we're stopping surprise medical bills and making everything transparent
and when we have that wall built you have to see what happens to the illegal aliens that don't come in
and you know they went after us on everybody knows the wall is going up
and you know this
and you look good i'll tell you what
and you've bitten me but why
another hospital the same test $2415
another one said 101000
another one said 125
another one was 118
at stake in our present battle is to survival actually of our nation
because she was devastated
because when providers are required to show you what the prices are those prices are going to come tumbling down
before i came into office the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country and that's what they want
blood tests as an example one hospital has them for $53
but as we keep on winning washington democrats keep on losing their minds
but i have something because people were screaming to me for the last four or five rallies read the snake
but i want to thank you both very much
but i'm not like those other politicians
but if i hadn't brought you in by now you truly would have died
but if you want to vote for a weak candidate tomorrow go ahead
but instead of saying thank you the snake gave her a vicious bite
but our trade agreement with china will defend our workers protect our intellectual property and substantially boost exports of american made goods
but then they got elected and they did absolutely nothing
but they mentioned illegal immigration right
but they want open borders
but we have done great
but we have more in this arena and outside of this arena than all of the other candidates meaning the democrats put together and multiplied times fave
but we're delivering for african americans
but we're draining that sucker slowly but surely
but you know what
but you know what
by the way they're going to take away everything
by the way we're going to keep it that way too if it's okay who was mumbling very distracting very distracting
can you believe it
can you imagine if you actually came from new hampshire what it would be
china i spoke with president xi and they're working very very hard and i think it's going to all work out fine
come here
come on
come on up ivanka
concord

corey lewandowski who loves this state a lot

i won seven times sir and i've won five of those damn contests
i'd like to apologize for the behavior of the united states
i'd like to not talk to that person
i'll take you in and i'll take care of you
i'm just picking these people out of the audience
i'm one for one
i'm speaking and a woman is mumbling terribly behind me angry
ice officers are the toughest human beings and they love the country as much as anybody in this room
if i had one empty seat here one empty seat in this massive arena they'd say 
if it blows wonderful
if it doesn't blow you got problems
if you want to shut down sanctuary cities if you want to protect your family and your loved ones you must vote republican in 2020 november
if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have toward victory november 3rd 2020
illegal crossings are down now at record numbers and we've ended catch and release
illegal immigrants coming in coming into our country illegally very few of them are getting in right now
illegal immigration
in god we trust
in one case longer than eight years
in the house we won 196 to nothing and then we got three democrats

it's really boring to watch but i try and watch
it's true
it's we
jared kushner
just come on in folks we're going to give you free healthcare
last month we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with china that will defeat so many of our opponents
last year alone they arrested over 2000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery rape and murder
last year the democrat controlled new hampshire house blocked legislation that would have banned sanctuary cities in your state
let's drain the swamp
like to say nice everyone's nice
lindsey you're a total pro
listen to how quiet
live free or die
live free or die
look at these front row people

lot of guts
lowering utility bills and reducing prices at the pump that's what we're doing
make a good speech
make america great again
man look at all that television back there
massive tariff and tariff money is pouring in and has poured in poured in by the billions and billions
matt
matt gates
maybe rander lindsey
mexico has been terrific
mike johnson
mike johnson great lawyer
most incredible thing that's happened
my only problem is i'm trying to figure out who is their weakest candidate
my wife thinks i'm a total loser sir
nafta what nafta to your communities i mean to your state is incredible
nah the 401ks they're up 90% 95%
never not one time
new hampshire alone lost one in four manufacturing jobs following that twin disaster of nafta and china's entrance into the wto the world trade organization one of the truly bad deals ever made in the history of our country
new hampshire was founded by tough frontier men and strong powerful pioneer women who defied the dangers and raised their children to embrace the eternal motto 
no good
no i have an obligation to watch really boring stuff
no no
nobody knows
nobody knows who won
not bad matt
not so much anymore
now i can't tell you what's happening tomorrow because you know you have some pretty strange election laws here right
now they respect us again
now they're getting out and because our economy is so good and because of what we've done with criminal justice reform and other things like opportunities zones et cetera they're getting jobs and employers are loving them
now watch how quiet it gets
now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of new hampshire
oh concord
oh don't put up your hand
oh will that be nice to have kevin a pro
on no issue of washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than a thing called immigration right
on our way to work one morning down the path along the lake a tender hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake
once i won i'm telling you he was so good
one of guests at the state of the union was american citizen jody jones
one of their prime candidates today they worked a big deal
only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all
our country is stronger today than ever before
our leader kevin mccarthy
our military would rebuilt it
out of three years 141
over 2000 accused of murder yet left wing politicians support sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into the american community
people are signing up left and right
people come up to me
pick one
pick the weakest one you think i don't know who it is
poor thing
president trump said every family coming into our country illegally gets a brand new free rolls royce
pretty good
pretty good
prisoners never really had a shot
probably the number one reason i ran for office
proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
read the transcripts
read the transcripts please
ready
redemption from illegal aliens that are coming
remember last time
remember president obama you could keep your plan
republicans are fighting for citizens from every background every community and every walk of life
right
right
right
right
right
right
rocky's killer had been previously arrested many many times but under california's totally insane and outrageous sanctuary law authorities were ordered to set him free
rough rough stuff but i think it's going to work out good
rough stuff i tell you
said the reptile with a grin
same exact test
senator i ran once and i won just once
setting all kinds of records polling records contribution records everything
shattered your communities and sacrifice your jobs on the altar of globalism
she clutched him to her bosom
she cried
she cried 
she didn't love me before sir
she hurried home from work that night and as soon as she arrived she found that pretty snake she'd taken in had been fully fully revived
she knows
she loves me again
she loves me again
she stroked his pretty skin again and kissed him and held him tight
she thinks i am the worst person with money with financial
she thinks i'm a total genius when it comes to finance
she thinks i'm just horrible
she wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk
she's been standing outside for four days no wonder
shut up silly woman
since my election america's gained 7 million new jobs
sir i've won seven times sir
so i hear a lot of republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the democrats
so important
so we now have built over 100 miles of wall
so we up to over a hundred substantially more than a hundred miles of wall and we'll have close to 500 miles of wall in the very near future
so we'll do this quickly
so what's happening
so you go back four years eight years
so you take his name and then you have to release him into the country and you say 
some of these great senators look at lindsey over there and look at rand
southern senator
steve scalise
steve stepanek

that swamp is that dirty swamp
that tells you something about money doesn't it
that used to be big
that was a big evening
that was a guy that said that but i love him too
that's a dirty swamp
that's bigger than healthcare transparency and that'll go unfortunately into effect right around the election time
that's bigger than those terrible academy awards i've got to tell you
that's bringing prices down
that's going to be great for our manufacturers our farmers
that's not bad
that's not bad
that's not bad but they have been great
that's pretty amazing
that's pretty amazing
that's something and in one case we got 53 to nothing but i don't even count that to be honest
that's the same concord that we read about all the time right
that's what this is all about
that's why millions of registered democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement
the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country
the democrats don't like them
the democrats don't like them
the doctor told me he didn't have a good chance but he's tough as hell and he's a really terrific friend

the new hampshire house republican leader dick hinch
the people can hear the crowd

the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and the late great abraham lincoln right
the snake
the unemployment rate among african americans hispanic americans and asian americans has reached record lows all time never been lower than what it is now
the unemployment rate has hit the lowest rate in half a century
the usmca will bring jobs back to new hampshire right where they belong
there was a little anger back there
these are warriors
these are warriors
these courageous americans tamed the wilderness braved the elements changed the hills fought the battles and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are making it greater
these great senators
they always show my face
they are doing great first time ever
they are warriors also
they betrayed all of us
they betrayed us all
they build a windmill within distance of your house
they can't even count their votes
they can't take a joke
they change like magic
they come into the country they don't have addresses
they don't come in
they don't even like showing the crowd
they don't get it matt do they matt

they don't know what they're doing
they fly around take pictures
they gave me a pinocchio

this is about immigration
this is illegal immigration
this was a song from the 1950s al green
through merit and legally
to support working families we've reduced the cost of childcare expanded paid leave and given 40 million american families an average of $2200 more in their pockets thanks to the republican child tax credit
to uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 federal judges who will interpret the constitution as written
together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair sane and lawful system of immigration
together we will make america wealthy again

what
what's your address
when he finally did awake i said 
while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with this vile hoax we've been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages enacting fair trade deals securing our borders and lifting up citizens of every race color religion and creed
who would have thought that
who's that woman from michigan to head up the rnc
whoa
whoa
why aren't we impeaching him
why do you say that
wind
wind
with your help on november 3rd we are going to defeat the radical socialist democrats
with your help we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working
yes i think 60000
you are such a fighter
you believe that one
you can keep your doctor
you catch an illegal alien by law
you could forget about your house
you could just say well that was the end of that investment
you could keep 28 times
you do know who's paying for the wall don't you
you ever hear the thing with all the modern technology all of the new computers the new genius the new everything cyber this cyber that two things never change right
you ever see what happens
you got them all over the place
you have some really evil dirty horrible people
you have to see the numbers change like magic
you have to see what happens when that wall goes up
you have to understand an entire party is fighting
you knew damn well i was a snake before you took me in
you know how famous concord is
you know i said that matt
you know it was very distracting
you know they always talk about the democrats
you know what catch and release is
you know your bite is poisonous and now i'm going to die
you paid a fortune not to pay a fortune for bad healthcare
you people wouldn't do that
you remember it was a really terrible thing was happening
you saw last month being bye-bye
you then take his name and address
you want to see a bird graveyard go to the bottom of a windmill
you were one of the worst examples ever
you wouldn't believe it
you'll see things get done like you'll never believe
you're going to win
you're so beautiful
you've seen what we did
your nrcc chairman mr tom emmer
$16 billion
00 whatever time 
1024
138
17%
30 years
5-million votes and we won
500 miles
9% of the people coming in
a fantastic man fantastic family
a few years ago if we had a problem like you saw two days ago in the middle east we would've been in a panic
a general came into my office in my first few weeks you remember
a great brilliant man brett kavanaugh
a great gentleman who loves the republican party co-chairman tommy hicks
a lot of people didn't know
a lot of that money's going to be spent in the state of the art military equipment that's being used at holloman air force base white sands missile range kirkland air force base and many other vital new mexico military installations that are going up as we speak
a lot of those trillions because you know when you do the 716 and the 730 and the 700 billion all of a sudden you're in trillions and i can save a lot of lines when i just say trillions
a massive wall
a single car
african-americans the best numbers that we've ever had in the history of our country
after two years they found nothing
after years of building up other countries we're finally building up our country
all democrats
all of that money trillions and trillions of dollars spent all produced right here in the good old usa
all these are in play and play means we could lose them right
all these things we've done
although not if i were your president
always complaining not doing great but they wanted a wall in san diego good mayor in san diego by the way
amazing
america is thriving like never before
america is winning again
and a few years ago almost every one of these they're on tape
and above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one america
and after years of stagnation that you know very well wages for hispanic-americans are rising really fast up nearly 8% since my election
and america is respected again like it hasn't been for a long time
and among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are hispanic americans who obey our laws pay their taxes contribute to our communities and play by the rules and they're the ones that want to see something done and we are doing it at a level that nobody else would be capable of doing it
and another great friend of mine somebody that was on cnn and they didn't like him because he was too positive on trump
and as a result of our nonstop efforts and billions and billions of dollars invested last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths and it was a very big decline in nearly three decades
and as the wall goes up it becomes less and less of a problem because as the wall gets up people aren't getting through
and as you know for the presidential races michigan hadn't been won in decades and she kept saying 
and at the center of america's drug crisis this is where the hispanics know it better than anybody
and by the way i'm just seeing this great group of people this spirit is there any place in the world that's more fun or more exciting than a trump rally
and by the way no president should ever have to go through what i've gone through either
and by the way our country is doing great
and by the way you have thousands and thousands of people outside who can't get in
and california wants you to do the other cars and we don't
and don't forget what i did for israel with respect to golan heights
and even with the me too movement we can't say this but i'll say it anyway you're better looking including the men including the men
and every day and you know as well as i do we're battling against the corrupt establishment of the past and we're achieving historic victories for the american people
and every day of my presidency we will never forget that we are americans and the future belongs to us
and everyone said 
and for the first time they've tried to get that for 45 years they haven't been able to get it but i'm good at getting things
and he looked at me and he goes 
and he's a great man by the way a great talent
and he's been to a couple of rallies too haven't you
and i always say 2016 i don't know if there'll ever be another 2016
and i can tell you because i meet so many of the leaders and their presidents and their kings and their queens and their prime ministers and their everything dictators every once in a while
and i didn't see any negative hand gesture right
and i do want it to live but they have to be they have to change their ways
and i have to tell you new mexico i know you're going to like this
and i just put out a statement
and i just put out a statement on social media that said i don't think they'll do it but they should for the good of the nation 
and i just want to tell you it's an honor
and i knew that was going to happen
and i said 
and i said 
and i said to this general 
and i tell you the farmers do love trump they do love trump
and i think we're going to win this state easy
and i want to just tell you that mexico is doing a great job for us on the border and i want to thank the president of mexico
and i want to tell you the words very little he didn't use because it was less than that
and i will never ever allow them to take away your sacred right to keep and bear arms
and i will tell you in other words it's all a game
and i won michigan
and i'll be honest while we have to put up with these people and others are it's incredible
and i'll take it
and i'll tell you they always start off today i had the crown prince of bahrain and they come in and they say 
and i'll tell you what 99% of them would never have been able to take it
and i'm enriching myself
and i'm thrilled to be here in albuquerque with thousands of hard-working freedom-loving american patriots
and if i did that they'd go crazy
and if you don't take them out and they're in new mexico i got to tell you something folks
and if you want to stop all these people from threatening our communities and poisoning our youth you know it's poisoning our youth
and in all fairness i helped a lot too
and instead of being down by 17 points he easily won the election 4000 or 5000 votes
and it was something
and it's drawing strong bipartisan support from all across your state and all across the country
and it's great comm in the oval office
and it's not just a little bit positive
and it's one of the reasons that as the world is not doing great you look at europe and you look at asia and china's not doing too well
and ladies and gentlemen of the great state of new mexico we love you
and left-wing democrats want to confiscate your guns and eliminate your god-given right to self-defense
and median income think of that median income for hispanic-americans surpassed $50000 for the first time ever
and mexico's already passed it and canada's ready to pass it soon as we do
and now $738 billion
and now they have a new one
and now we're replacing nafta with the brand new us-mexico-canada agreement usmca
and our military is by far the greatest in the world
and out of the tens of billions we gave our great farmers because they were targeted by china because china knows very smart that the farmers love trump and trump loves the farmers
and people that had houses they didn't like people running over their gardens all day long coming in from the other side
and plenty of people even in california where they have sanctuary cities they don't want sanctuary cities
and republicans will always support the heroes of ice border patrol and our great law enforcement
and ronna mcdaniel was the republican party chair of michigan
and she has done an incredible job
and since my election natural gas productions big story today in new mexico has increased by 40% 4-0
and since then three years $700 billion we've spent then $716 billion
and so many of these democrats that are against the wall it's common sense
and some cheap pencils
and that means great wages and it means jobs
and that's changing also you see what's happening and when these rich countries think we're going to pay for their military every year billions and billions and billions and they're rich and they take our business and we're supposed to on top of everything else i could tell you stories but i'm going to save them for the campaign
and that's in a short period of time
and that's okay
and that's what we have
and that's why you're breaking every single record in your state's book
and the democrats could change these laws
and the only reason i'm not moving it to new mexico is that it would cost more money to move it than to build you a brand new beautiful wall so i'll give you a brand new beautiful wall
and the other won a race that he was way way way back
and the reason they're safer is because they could be a little bit heavier
and the venezuelans and the cubans are all for trump i will tell you that
and the woman involved said she didn't know anything
and then i hate to say this but we have some republicans they're not good
and then i'll just sit back i'll say 
and these are very very dishonest people and they know it
and they still want him to be impeached
and they were all set
and they were going crazy on television
and they'd say 
and they've generated nearly a billion-dollar budget surplus in new mexico
and this is the country where they have the security and where they do have the action
and this means more jobs higher wages and american energy independence which is what we have
and to be honest with you you've got to elect president trump
and to keep new mexico's farms ranches and small businesses in the family we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children
and together we will make america wealthy again
and toward the end of the night they started dismantling that studio
and unfortunately the stock market's only a few points from its all time high which we've broken on i think it's well over a hundred times
and utah they said was it play
and we are now a net exporter of energy
and we campaigned and we worked hard right
and we have a man in the audience who is i think the best dressed man in this entire place including me right here
and we still won
and we will always live by the words of our national motto
and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
and we're all so aggressively combating the opioid epidemic which is horrible
and we're building an amazing future for citizens of every background race religion color and creed
and we're going to have a lot done anyway
and we're here for a number of reasons but we're here because we really think we're going to turn this state and make it a republican state
and we're investing in our nation's nuclear security including right here in new mexico and sandia national laboratories and los alamos national laboratory
and we're trying to do the same thing with cars
and we've taken in tens of billions of dollars worth of tariffs and we've given those tariffs and by the way china's eating the tariffs they're devaluing their currency the prices are very similar
and while you're at it the russian witch-hunt hoax which is just as phony a story
and yet all of these radical left crazies are in judiciary committee and all of these committees that are set up to hurt the country
and yet for whatever reason it's been quite a while since a republican won this state
and you must never forget
and you're going to get the chance very soon
and your state's energy revenues are up by nearly two-thirds
another president would have given up a long time ago
as soon as it was finished the day it was finished i was notified
as your president i will never allow them to take away your liberty your dignity and your social security
asian-americans the best numbers that we've ever had in history
because anything i want they want to do the opposite
because california you know once we build it they'll complain
because i think the most important thing is our military and protecting our country right
because our laws are so bad they're so pathetic
because president obama did us a great favor when i came in i said 
because the hispanic-americans they understand they don't want criminals coming across the border
because they break all the time
because to be honest this is a little earlier than the campaign
because we have a better chance of defeating him if there's a recession
because what we've achieved in the last almost three years is unparalleled
because you understand it better than other people but at the whole center of this crisis is the drugs that are pouring in and you understand that when other people don't understand it
best is yet to come
billion
billion not million
boom
brad parscale
but a few years ago they would have been in a panic
but all the way in we had people and they were waving
but all those jobs are gone and we're bringing them back
but democrats will never get the chance because new mexico will never give them that chance
but earlier today in the white house i had the honor of awarding the presidential medal of freedom that's the highest civilian award to someone who truly embodies the american dream baseball legend the greatest by the way the greatest relief pitcher of all time you look at those records mariano rivera
but have you listened to the so-called washington elite now why are they elite
but he turned out to be tough and smart
but i didn't really have a track record because i never did this stuff before
but i hope they still like me
but i was early with her and frankly oh it's coming back don't worry about her
but i'll be saying 
but i'll tell you what
but i'll tell you what i expected that when i did this in terms of opportunity in terms of certain places they can never do as well when you have this kind of rhetoric they can never do
but i'm telling them i don't want to do this too early
but if you want to stop the drug smugglers human traffickers and vicious ms-3 gang members which we're taking out every year by the thousands and getting them the hell out of our country because of ice
but in the meantime we're doing really well
but it was very interesting because not too long ago i saw where the hispanic-american the hispanics were up with me in a poll 17%
but it's the greatest single decision i've ever made because our country is turning around so rapidly
but michigan's doing great
but on the assumption that you love your children you'll be able to use small farms and your ranches and things
but right now it's like a great tree or a great plant you plant it and it has to take hold
but that's okay
but the radical left democrats want to demolish everything that we've gained
but then i said 
but they still so the new york times had to put out a major apology and they had to change their story
but they're very happy with their wall
but think of it for you and for texas and for so many other places they want to get rid of your energy
but those days are over under this administration
but we had a victory two victories north carolina where one was 17 points down three weeks ago we got involved we started sending out lots of different social media messages we did a couple of little robo calls but the big thing we did a speech the night before
but we had two great victories congressional victories on tuesday night
but we have much to celebrate
but we have the best numbers every category that we've ever had
but we have the mexican soldiers out there
but we won the great state of michigan and now we're doing really well because we've moved a lot of car companies
but we're bound by these convictions
but we're going to win this state
but we're in the oval office and they're not
but what are they going to do about china and india and russia and other countries that are spewing stuff
but when i'm on the debate stage debating one of these far left radical democrats whoever it may be and they start telling you what they're going to do for you and you say 
but when it's your time to kick the bucket you worked hard
but you know i really like the guy
but you know the universe is so big that when you talk about china the usa india you talk about these different places where a lot of bad stuff comes out right
but you know we won a big case two months ago in the supreme court that allowed us to do what we're doing
buttigieg
buttigieg
can you believe
can you believe it
can you believe it
can you even believe it
can you imagine
can you imagine right
cars have so much junk on them now to save a tiny little fraction of gasoline
china's been taking out from 300 billion to $500 billion a year
choice

crucially for your state we have ended the last administration's war on american energy
crude oil production in new mexico has more than doubled and going up a lot higher very quickly
dan thank you dan
democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion and socialism
did you notice the other day they were saying 
did you see google
did you see the new york times
did you see what democrats they're calling for his resignation
did you see what they're doing
did you watch the debate the other day
didn't put them up couldn't get them approved
do you believe that one
do you know
does that make sense
does that make sense
don't do it
don't do it sir
don't forget right
don't get it to them
don't leave it to them
donald trump has won the great state of michigan
donald trump has won the state of utah
donald trump has won this state of texas
donald trump is down two points to buttigieg
done so much for charity
emolument nobody ever heard that word emolument
every major democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would destroyed medicare as we know it today
every once in a while you get an a rogue dictator
every one of them used the word 
everybody said it was impossible
everybody was against us
explain that
explain that one right
farmers love love love it and everybody wants it
following decades of outsourcing and offshoring our jobs and factories are coming back home where they belong
for many decades our leaders put global interests and special interests ahead of your interests
for six months i was hearing that i'm going to lose the state of texas and friends of mine from texas that look just like these guys
for the vets we got choice
for years you watched as your politicians apologize for america
frankly they all should have done a lot of things that we're doing right now
from two-million to 10
get out and vote
get out there and vote and get ready and get everybody
give me a break
give me a little bit more time okay
good night
good night to that person

great great men
great guy
great job
great job brad
hasn't been won in decades
he did it right in the crescendo
he happens to be hispanic
he happens to be hispanic but i've never quite figured it out because he looks more like a wasp than i do
he said 
he said i may have lost two-million to 10-million votes according to this character that worked at google right
he says the country
he wants to leave his wealth
he was something
he won by a lot
he won by a lot
he's enriching himself
here's another one of my friends
hispanic-american poverty reached a brand new all-time low in history
honestly when i ran i didn't know that
hopefully they'll put it up for a vote
how about these phony democrats
how did we win
how did we win
how do i lose new mexico
how do we lose that one
how do you top that
how is that
how is that
how is that
how the hell did we win
how they got that it took years and years to end up
huh
i actually priced it out
i asked the people the professionals 
i assume i have no judges to appoint
i believe in the environment
i call for the resignation of everybody at the new york times involved in the kavanaugh smear story
i could not be happier despite what they put us all through
i did
i did more than any president in history and they've been there for many years
i didn't hear that
i didn't hear you
i didn't know what would happen if i lost
i didn't know who she was
i disagree with a lot of things
i don't know
i don't know about it me but you look all much better than you did three years ago
i don't know about you but i know a lot about texas and donald trump is not going to be losing the state of texas
i don't know about you in new mexico but i'm not into flies or mosquitoes
i don't know what happened but we started off with 138 now we're up to 180
i don't like either kind of snake
i don't like snakes either
i don't like snakes too much
i don't like those suckers
i don't mind being embarrassed
i don't remember that
i don't want to bring it up because i don't want to do it too early
i don't want to do it
i expected to do that when i did it
i guess they don't like a strong military
i just readied the big beautiful crescendo and this character's going back home
i just signed my 150th federal judge and court of appeals judge and we already have two great supreme court justices gorsuch and kavanaugh
i keep saying i go to a stadium we sell out to thousands of people lines that are miles long
i know a guy who can't stand his children they're horrible horrible human beings
i know what you want
i like that beautiful red tie you're wearing
i may have to go for the hispanics to be honest
i mean and every friend of mine says 
i mean explain that one
i mean honestly i mentioned the president of mexico
i mean if we go by the old standards better houses better schools made much more money lived better had everything going and then i decide to run for president
i mean in all fairness i don't want to go too early here
i mean they make them now like paper mache
i mean winning was great
i mean you got to be a a world class pole vaulter or a world class mount everest type climber
i must be honest with you worst year in 57 years i'd say that's not good
i never want a president of the united states to be in that position
i never want to see a president in a position like that where we may have conflict and a general looks at him and said ‘we have very little/ no ammunition
i recognized israel's true capitol and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said i was going to cut your regulations
i said to our secretary of agriculture sonny perdue i said 
i see it
i tell japan sorry big deficits with all these countries we're changing it but you've got to get car companies
i think he's great
i think i like the kind on the ground better than the ones we have in washington
i think so
i think they going to love it
i think they're going to love it
i told my people that was going to happen
i told this story for the first time today
i told this story the other night
i understand that it's about your family
i want a lot of things
i want an incandescent light
i want the cleanest air
i want the cleanest water on the planet
i want to give their name
i want to just yeah
i want to look better okay
i want to pay less money to look better
i would say naive but maybe it's much worse than that
i would've lost and lost billions then i would have been really unhappy
i'd asked them but we're not going to get a straight answer
i'd have to go around
i'd like to say i have a lot
i'd love to take the sucker down and move it right now to new mexico
i'll be so surprised
i'll say 
i'll take it
i'll tell you tuesday night the fake news was not happy
i'll tell you we're finding them left and right
i'll tell you what
i'm doing a good job as your messenger but basically i'm a messenger
i'm not going to get into detail but you know what i'm talking about
i'm sorry
i'm telling you all the same sort of things
i'm the least racist person in this room
i've always take offense when somebody said 
i've been there for two and a half
if foreign companies do not want to pay our tariffs there is one very simple solution
if it were distributed it could actually has the power to kill half of the country
if somebody buys a tank of gas in scotland from an airport that i don't own and they happen to go to a hotel he's enriching himself like 20 people i'm going to lose billions of dollars and that's okay
if there's a wait they go out they get a private doctor
if they're not good leave it to charity
if you don't love them don't even listen to the last line because it won't matter
if you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers how about the human traffic and they traffic really for the most part in women that's what they traffic in it's women
in a few short weeks we'll be up to 180 sounds impossible federal judges including court of appeals judges
in fact i shouldn't tell you this but my geniuses my people some of those people standing right there right there some of them right there they said 
in god we trust
in other words the democrats want to completely annihilate new mexico's economy
in san diego california is very difficult
incredible
incredible people
incredible people incredible people
instead of waiting for two months to see a doctor or two weeks or three days they now go out
is there anything
is this the best they can do
isn't that nice
it all goes away
it does
it doesn't work that way folks
it is
it was a beautiful day at the white house so it was good
it was a little dangerous out there
it was before it's time
it was no good and we oppose the toughest ever sanctions on the iranian regime
it will happen
it would be so much easier with a little stroke of the pen
it'll be very embarrassing
it's a better term though because this way they can't get skunked but they can get skunked with me
it's a great it's a great structure
it's a great structure
it's a great thing
it's a made-up story
it's a model for the entire world
it's about achievement
it's about the fate of your country
it's about the future of our great country
it's about you
it's about you
it's about you
it's about your future and it's about the fate of your country for your children for everybody
it's all gases inside and you're supposed to bring it back to where you bought it in a sealed container
it's all right
it's amazing
it's an incredible agreement
it's been a long time
it's been a long time
it's been funded
it's been funded
it's crazy
it's going to be a disaster
it's going to be very popular
it's much nicer
it's not fair
it's not happening anymore
it's not this
it's one of the reasons we had big victories two of them in north carolina sanctuary cities
it's pretty amazing
it's pretty amazing
it's really doing the trick
it's right next to each other
it's right next to each other
it's so big that it's right next to each other
it's time to finally take care of our own
it's too much
it's true
it's true
it's true
it's true

just like mom i see it
latinos for trump
leave it to something else
let anybody come in
let it be unsafe

look you know what i saw the other day
made in the usa
make it electric
makes sense right
manufactured
manufactured
massive protest
massive protest at the trump rally
maybe another 10%
maybe they'll change and i don't want them to change
more than any state in the united states
more than seven million americans have been lifted off of food stamps
more than we needed
most of them won't say it
my administration is fighting to empower all americans to reach their dreams and achieve their potential
my administration will protect medicare and defend your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you
my friend and a really talented guy he just gets the hell knocked out of him all the time
nancy pelosi they put it up for vote
nearly 600000 americans came into the labor force last month alone
new mexico
new mexico republican party chairman
no collusion no obstruction no nothing
no food no water no nothing
no i don't mind being embarrassed
no i think of it it's safer and it's less expensive by $3500 on average
no i think we're going to do great here
no it's crazy
no matter what label they use a vote for any democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the american dream
no more cows no more airplanes no more trips
no no i'm more elite than them
no one person just going home to mommy a little bit sooner
no president should ever have to go through it
no sir you have 138 judges
no they're made out of paper mache
no think of it
no we need a wall
no we're going to win new mexico
nobody even knew that
nobody ever heard the word emolument before
nobody loves the hispanics more
nobody will ever take it down
nobody will ever take it down
nothing they throw it away
november
now a few years later they don't want a wall
now if it's close like it's in play you wait two three four or five hours to see what it is but they don't even a breath because they're called suppression poles and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people see
now if you don't like your children don't do it
now new mexico you know that you were totally devastated by another disaster known as nafta
now that's called collusion folks
now think of it
now under the green new deal that all goes away
now what we've done on regulations is incredible
now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for new mexico
now you're all looking good
oh boy
oh boy
oh please let there be a recession please
oh the hispanics won't like a wall
oh we'll pass it
okay
one of the smartest most brilliant students top at yale incredible life incredible family
one of them it was going to be very very close
otherwise people will say 
our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 50 years
our ancestors crossed the oceans settled a continent tamed the wilderness revolutionized industry pioneered sciences won two world wars defeated fascism and communism put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world
our communities do not have the resources nor the budgets to handle the massive influx of immigrants we are experiencing
our country is going to be greater than it ever was
our scarce resources are in danger of being rapidly depleted to the point that we will be unable to effectively care for our own citizens you and our existing homeless populations many of whom are american veterans right
our shared republican agenda is pro-worker pro-jobs pro-family pro-growth and 100% pro-american
past leaders invited china to freely loot and pillage the united states economy
people are coming back now because they want to be where the action is
people came in they took your jobs they had no border they had no border control
people love our first lady
people said 
please don't do it sir
please please
please sir don't do that
president clinton should have done it
president obama 
president obama left us with a few beauties right
president obama should have done it
president trump
president trump is tired of listening to the elite
presidents bush should have done it
probably i can say they're coming back like never before
probably it would have been there for four weeks
putting it first
race
race religion color and creed
ready
really
remember that
remember that great great night
remember the couple of people that were crying
remember the word 
remember when they say 
republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding americans not for criminal aliens
republicans believe that we must take care of our own citizens first
revenues from energy production provide up to 25% of your state's budget and going much higher in the very near future
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right here in new mexico democrats are trying to turn you into a total sanctuary state creating a safe harbor for dangerous criminal aliens and gang members that sanctuary policies release from jail
say it again
see these two guys with the hates
see they don't maybe trust us that's why
see they don't say it's in play
she can never recover and will never return to greatness under current management
she said 
sheriffs and commissioners from nine mexico counties recently sent a letter to your state's congressional delegation begging them to vote for strong border security they want in new mexico
since my election the number of new business applications for new mexico has increased by almost 30% more than any state in the united states
single car
sir don't get involved in that race sir
sir i'd like to congratulate you on what you've done with the economy of the united states
sir if you keep coming back you're going to win michigan
sir it'll cost more money to move the wall that they built a new one
sir we have very little ammunition
so anyway no president should ever be put in that position
so democrats put illegal aliens before american citizens
so essentially that's saying you're in a certain category which is a very important category you're doing better than any state in the united states
so i always say the democrat party but that's their name the democrat party
so i haven't figured that one out
so i just want to thank all of the representatives of mexico
so i said i was going to cut your taxes
so i'll lose billions of dollars always expected
so if you look at it nobody did it so i'm doing it and that's what's going to happen
so let's help him
so now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from china
so there's something going on
so they've given up on every other hoax but it doesn't work that way
so think of that
so we love you we love you we appreciate it
so we put up a wall and i thought everybody would be happy
so we're building the wall the army corps of engineers we're doing a beautiful job
so what are they going to do
so what i want to do is the following
so when ms-13 comes in and i told you before we take them out by the thousands and they're tough
so when we won the election i said 
socialism
some have been demolished some have been reconverted into senior citizen housing and housing
somebody had to do something with china
somebody said in the great state of texas 
somebody touches them and the entire car collapses
sonny how much did the farmers get hit by china targeting them and pulling back and doing all sorts of things
steve pearce
steve that audience wasn't big enough for you
supposing i didn't make it
supposing i lost and we would have had the same basic rhetoric
supposing you know i'm doing all the things
take something good and turn it negative
texas is in play
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you dan bishop
thank you new mexico
thank you new mexico
thank you new mexico
thank you ronna
thank you steve
thank you very much
thank you very much commissioners
thank you very much president trump
that all goes away
that great great night
that happened and people came from the valleys
that includes millions of hardworking lawful immigrants who waited in line followed the rules and came into our country legally
that means i have more indian blood than she does and i have none unfortunately
that means you're the super elite
that means you're wealthy and you're getting wealthier fast
that should never happen
that turned out to be a fraud
that turned out to be be a fraud
that was a long drive
that was a long drive by the way 35 minutes
that'll be very good
that's a big deal
that's also jobs but more importantly than even jobs incredible
that's not bad
that's not happening anymore
that's okay
that's real collusion
that's the best they can do
that's the only reason
that's the problem with politics
that's the ultimate cleaning of the swamp
that's what it is it's nothing other than that it's very simple
that's what it's about
that's what we have
that's where we're headed
that's why you're liking trump because you're not going to let that happen
that's your median
the 2020 election is about one thing
the aids epidemic in this country will be gone within 10 years
the bay of pigs award
the best is yet to come
the border crisis every day dangerous criminal cartels smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across your southern border including heroin meth cocaine and fentanyl and we're stopping them now
the democrat agenda of open borders places vast burdens on your communities and your schools and your hospitals and public safety all at the expense of hardworking new mexico families and throughout our country
the democratic party is much nicer than the democrat party but their name is the democrat party and i'm not looking for them to sound nice
the democrats are also trying to turn every city in america into a sanctuary for criminal aliens and that's one of the very good reasons we won on tuesday night north carolina because they let people out of their sanctuary city and what those people did i will not tell you tonight but it wasn't good
the democrats want us to be subservient to foreign producers
the dona ana county board of commissioners all democrats just unanimously endorsed the usmca and urged congress to pass it immediately
the failed liberal establishment in washington squandered your tax dollars shipped away your jobs sacrificed your sovereignty and bogged us down in one foreign war or debacle call it whatever you want after another
the fake news would never have allowed us to say that during the campaign even as a projection
the future belongs to each and every one of you
the gases come out they're dangerous
the hermit nation
the left tries to threaten bully intimidate americans into submission
the manufactured crisis started
the muller report came out
the naive politicians they don't want ice to come in
the next one 
the numbers are plummeting down
the one gentleman won by a number that nobody thought even possible so much
the politicians do but they don't want them
the polls in texas are closed
the polls in utah are closed
the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and it is the party of the american dream
the republicans love it and the democrats love it and frankly labor loves it
the republicans will always do that
the rhinos are worse and some of them are worse than the obama people right
the same devotion to family and the same profound faith that america is blessed by the eternal grace of almighty god
the same people that are saying 
the times is dead
the turnout was beyond belief
the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world
the woman said 
the yankees won a lot of world series because of mariano
their ratings aren't good
then they went to race
then they went to recession there's going to be a recession
then you have the deep state
there is nobody that loves his country more or hispanic more than steve cortez steve
there's never been an administration that in the first two and a half years has done what we've been able to do or achieve
there's nobody that even comes close
there's nobody tougher
there's not a person in the room that i couldn't find something on with that
there's not too many around like that
these are phony people but that's okay
these are the little things that i have to explain
they all say it
they all should have done it
they came from everywhere
they came from places that nobody's ever talked about before and it was the forgotten men and women but the truth is i know these men and women and they're the most incredible men and women in this country
they can't do that
they capture women and they bring them across the open borders and they don't go through ports of entry where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else
they could be a little bit heavier
they could change them so quickly
they didn't understand
they don't even like you
they don't even take a breath
they don't have a-list talent but they had the best they could have
they don't like cutting regulations
they don't like low taxes
they don't like right to try you know right to try
they don't treat us right
they don't want criminals pouring into your communities and doing what they do and we won't even talk about that
they don't want open borders
they don't want people taking their jobs
they don't want to take these criminals out
they gave me the bay of pigs award
they get taken care of
they go out into the desert areas and they hang a left or they hang a right and they come in but now when you have a wall they can't do that
they had their studios all built
they have been loyal to themselves
they have it but the commission your commissioners wrote i quote 
they have so much junk that they're less safe
they just never had anybody they really wanted to vote for or at least for a long time they didn't want to get out there
they know what i'm talking about now
they like what we're doing
they listen to the environmentalists and i'm an environmentalist
they love it
they might even be better looking
they needed it
they really are
they said 
they said 
they said 
they say 
they say 
they say 
they say 
they say i enrich myself because somebody is going to stay at my hotel
they say texas is in play
they spent $40 million
they spent think of it they found nothing
they started with russia russia russia
they took away our light bulb
they try to blacklist coerce cancel or destroy anyone who gets in their way
they use democrat prosecutors and phony congressional committees whenever they can
they used the word manufacturer on something never been used for that thing and every news gets 
they want strong these are people that are with you in many cases democrats
they want the wall
they want to bury you in regulation
they want to erase american history crush religious liberty indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology
they want to have that security and they want the wall
they want to make your whole state a sanctuary state
they want to raise your taxes
they want to take away your health insurance 180 million americans
they want us to be at the mercy of rogue regimes
they wanted a wall
they weigh about three pounds and if you get hit by a bus it's over
they were going that was not a good night for certain people
they were going that was not a good night going crazy on television
they were not happy
they were not happy
they won't be losing it to the banks five years later
they won't like border security
they wouldn't have been able to take it
they write letters we need strong border security
they'll call us 
they'll do whatever they can to demean you to libel you
they're a little older now but they're horrible human beings
they're all for trump
they're building a big wall around the building they're building a big wall
they're calling for his impeachment
they're coming back like almost never before
they're eating the tariffs
they're gasping
they're gasping for air but we do have some bad people that you wouldn't believe
they're going to pass it as soon as we do
they're going to stay home and they're going to pay you a lot of money and everybody's going to be happy
they're naive these politicians
they're no different
they're not going to be leaving for lots of other countries including china including mexico
they're not trafficking in men
they're phony polls
they're poisoning our youth
they're pouring into san diego like going all over the place
they're pretty much on respirators
they're rhinos
they're suppression polls and i'll tell you what
they're too smart
they're tough but our ice folks are even tougher
they're unheard of
they're worse than the clinton people but there aren't too many of them left
they're worse than the obama people
they've taken the old gray lady do you know the new york times for years the old gray lady so prestigious they've taken the old great lady and broken her down destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation
think of it they wrote a story about somebody that said she doesn't remember this
think of that
think of that
think of that
think of that
think of the song
think of the song ymca
think of this
think of what $500 billion is
this crazy mueller report comes out 18 trump haters liberal democrats some worked for hillary clinton they found nothing
this crisis was manufactured

this is the end
this is your commissioners writing to us in washington
this was going to be the end of trump because this man was going to lose
this was one of the great catastrophes
those are unheard of numbers
to protect american security i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal
to stop the far left's campaign of destruction you must vote republican
today we got a lot of oil we got a lot of gas
together we will help millions more citizens know the dignity of work the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job really well done
tommy what a job

under our rules and regulations the cars are environmentally terrific but they're safer and they're $3500 less to buy right
under this administration america is working again
unemployment and losses

virtually every top democrat also now supports late-term abortion ripping babies straight from the mothers right up until the moment of birth and that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
wages in your state new mexico are growing at a rate of much more than 3% a year which is unheard of 20 years ago

we could whether it's asylum whether it's any of the laws we have so many of them that are so bad
we did a lot of things
we did something so great and it won't be on but if there's something that's just slightly negative or even if it's good that they could turn negative that's what they like best

ymca
you better be prepared because this is looking like it could really be conflict
you call them a rhino
you can forget it
you can't come back from 17 points sir
you could do with one less pencil
you don't hear this because the fake news doesn't want to write about it
you don't like to hear about it because you don't hear about it too much
you get it
you got a much better light at a much reduced cost and it's much safer because when those other bulbs break they really are dangerous
you got problems
you got problems
you had to see the people all the way in from the airport
you have great kids you love your kids they're taking care of you
you have only one choice
you have that and so you have the democrats you have the media their partners
you know
you know before i came they were all calling it democratic because it sounds better right
you know he could lose texas
you know it too
you know it's very interesting i hear everybody screaming well you know we're building the wall and it's going up and it's going up fast
you know just before the last election the cubans from miami where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%
you know right now we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country
you know sometimes i'll be in the oval office and i'll be with my people
you know that
you know that in new mexico you know exactly what i'm talking about
you know the people are pouring in
you know the pocahontas thing i did that it was before its time
you know the trans-pacific partnership tpp this would have destroyed the automobile business in our country
you know the word is loopholes and the democrats could do it fast
you know they don't treat us right
you know they have phony polls
you know what i'm going to say
you know what it's for
you know what let's build it someplace else
you know what we got
you know when i came here during the last election came here a little because i was told very hard to win and i came here a little but i saw great spirit
you know when you think of it i'm president and they're not
you know why
you know why
you know why
you know you come in and i've always heard the most important thing a president does i disagree with this by the way but that's okay
you must elect republicans
you must never forget
you never want to get too cocky
you pay much less money and you look much better and on top of that with the new bulbs if they break it's considered a hazardous waste site
you really love them
you saw the figures last week but we're doing it the hard way
you see it
you see the factories empty buildings empty hulks
you see the kind of numbers we're getting millions and millions and millions of dollars worth
you see them and they're stopping people
you take a look at what we're doing with all of the things
you'll be able to leave them to your children
you're going to have to really want to get over that wall to do it
you're going to win by a lot
you're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles
you're wealthier
you've got big problems
your children won't have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay tax
your farmers your ranchers everybody wants it
your politicians have not been loyal to you
your state lost 33% of its manufacturing jobs after nafta was signed
10 years was too much
10 years was too much
2016 was that the most exciting evening in the history of television
25000 people don't have to wear a mask nothing
306 306 to 223
5 billion people slightly more than you
5 trillion in the u
6 million people out of poverty the largest poverty reduction of any president in the history of our country
8 billion in cash
9 million jobs in the state of ohio
91% approval rating at the va
91% the highest ever
a
a
a friend of mine that i'll tell you this is the greatest optimist
a general came in
a great lawyer actually
a lot of people said that's the reason i won so easily in the electoral college last time
a lot of pressure put on me
a lot of these democrats states you see it the churches are closed
a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs and a limitless future for all americans
about i guess i have to call myself a politician
after spending more than five decades in washington he tells me 
again
again they say it's the most important thing and think of it
ah the polls and the doors are closed in ohio
all of a sudden everybody fell into line
all right
all these closed states they're going to be open on november 4th
an anonymous source has said that donald trump said this
and a lot of that's got to do with the fact that we're going to have one extra but we didn't think this was going to happen
and america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
and by the way a lot of the crazy bernie voters last time four years ago voted for trump because of trade because the one thing they do understand that our country has been off for years
and by the way thank you police
and by the way they want the boston bomber to be able to vote
and every week she went down down 15 points 12 points 11 points 9 points six points five points four points two points
and everybody out here loves you and they appreciate you
and everybody said 
and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs by 50% 60% and 70%
and guys would get on there and say 
and he cheered the rise of china as a very positive development for our country
and he was right
and here's the platform that they have
and i got a couple of calls from my friends the congressman right here
and i got calls
and i looked at this army tank plant in lima
and i made a terrible terrible mistake because i had to work my ass off to get that thing built
and i said 
and i said 
and i said 
and i saw it they're doing the pledge of allegiance
and i saw the people building the tanks and the technology's incredible
and i tell you what i saved lima
and i told this story last night
and i want to tell you if you go back a few months before this pandemic we were gaining gaining gaining
and i will tell you it's not a question of taking credit but truly we were the ones that did that
and i'll tell you what i'll bet on the numbers even though crazy nancy and these people don't want to give any stimulus they don't want to give anything
and i'm not talking
and i'm saying 
and i'm the only man that got nominated for a nobel peace prize and i didn't get any press
and if you ever closed it you'd never be able to open a thing like that again
and if you look at some of these jihadist nations no thank you
and in your state in ohio early voting has already begun and don't wait
and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-american lies
and instead of endless wars we are forging peace all over the middle east
and it's 
and it's exactly the wall the little more expensive wall they want like nice expensive but exactly what border patrol wanted
and it's not donald trump
and it's something we had to do
and jim jordan called me
and just as i said hope to god we never have to use them
and just in conclusion first of all it's been a great honor to be with you
and nbc which is one of the most crooked one of the worst newscasts and i'm talking about normal nbc not msdnc
and next year assuming we win which i hope we're going to win but if we win you're going to have a year next year
and now he wants to buy his way back into the democrat party
and now he's really incompetent
and now i got this guy standing up
and second amendment and all of the other things
and she said 
and so i had a news conference
and that's what it is
and the asian community
and the police in washington and we had national guard we had secret service
and the time came there's was only a problem nobody showed up
and the way we don't have to use them is to keep that kind of strength
and then all of a sudden the pressure became so great and the full league is opening now and it's going to be very exciting
and then i got calls from the biggest people in the world
and then i heard it a second time
and then israel with bahrain and uae and many more to come
and then it went through the whole show and they never mentioned
and then that night again 
and then that problem happened
and then they say 
and then they would have said 
and there was grass growing in the runways when i took over three and a half years ago
and there's no games
and they go 
and they meant it
and they said 
and they said 
and they start with a hurricane and then they went to something and something else
and they will do that
and this is the manifesto with bernie sanders with crazy bernie
and this one's going to be even better because nobody has done and then don't even challenge it the fake news nobody has done in three and a half years what we've done
and we called a couple of the top people at the universities and they got it going
and we did it and we got it done and nobody else got it done
and we did something and i'm happy about it
and we had no choice and hope to god we never have to use it because if you would ever see the power of what we've done over the last three years it's almost better for you not to see it
and we revived it because you can't get that approved by congress
and we started a little thing the commissioner and myself one of my guys he's fantastic and within a few days it started getting talked about and then we kept it going and we helped him with some testing because we have the greatest testing in the world
and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto 
and we're doing great in the polls with the black community and the hispanic community
and we're finishing up with our military
and what really spurred me on was when sleepy joe announced that i was the one that did it
and when barack obama barack hussein obama got nominated now when barack hussein obama got nominated he didn't know why he was nominated
and when you see them cheating on the other side i don't say if when when you see them cheating with those ballots all of those unsolicited ballots those millions of ballots you'll see them anytime you do report them to the authorities
and you have a lot of potential players but they couldn't play football
and you know what
and you know what
and you saw that
and you see it they want to tear down crosses from public spaces
and you'd still lose very big
are you struggling
around november 4th we're going to open
as president i always stand and i will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement
because 29% to 30% of these suburban communities are minorities
because again nobody has done what we've done
because i love you and you love me and that's the way it is
because now see i would never talk like that but when i saw that horrible thing and nobody's done more for the military than i have when i saw that horrible ad 
because they don't like it
because we did it and then we had to close it up
biden opposes school choice and vowed to ban charter schools
biden supported every globalist sellout of ohio workers for over a half a century including nafta china's entry into the world trade organization the disaster known as tpp and how about the paris climate accord
biden's justices will erase national borders they don't want borders protect sanctuary cities and compel the unlimited entry of foreign nationals
biden's justices will remove the words 
biden's running made even urged supporters to help the bail riders out of jail
biden's running mate kamilla
big pharma does not like me too much
big stuff
bob how we doing
bob i think you're great
bob paduchik
boy he was standing there
bring that to my office
but because of the ad i said 
but get out there on november 3rd and let's show him your stuff and show them the stuff of all of us
but he goes 
but he's got the circles
but i heard about big 10 football and because of this ad i said 
but i promised and i said 
but i should have said the mistake i should have said when i talked to these big crowds and the crowds are getting bigger there's more enthusiasm now than we ever had four years ago but i should have said instead of 
but i used to say just a week ago 
but i want to go in there with the national guard so bad
but i will tell you so all of a sudden they have schools
but it was closed it was gone it was announced that it was closed
but it wasn't winning ohio it was by the margin
but it's the swine flu
but it's true they used to talk about the wall all the time because they never thought i'd be able to get a bill
but once i found out it was i called the commissioner
but that's okay
but that's okay
but the military was great
but the truth is it's got a seat in and we have a lot of new things including additional substantial middle income tax cuts and other tax cuts and tremendous regulation cuts
but there was a case what do i know
but there was another chant that's happening at all these rallies
but they had a big hit and they'll take care of it
but they started hitting lincoln
but they want to ban all prayer in public schools and require taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion
but this rant is going on like it's crazy
but wait a minute
but was that the most exciting
but we did
but we don't want to open
but we had tremendous success
but we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world and the fastest economic recovery by far of any western nation by far
but you can't go to church
but you know why
but you know why
by the way if i wasn't here you wouldn't have a second amendment right now
by the way open your schools
by the way that includes minorities
by the way we are doing really well with the african american community with the hispanic community
by the way you do know they want to close it up
can you believe it
can you believe it
can you believe it 43 days
come up
come up here
come up here
come up here

he did well with african american community

he made this deal with crazy bernie
he misrepresented
he opposed killing soleimani
he pretends to care about blue collar workers
he ran my campaign
he really just left office
he said 
he said 
he said it could be better
he thought she was talking about me
he voted for the iraq war disaster
he wants no glamor
he wants no glory
he wants to buy his way back into the democrats
he was a part of the metoo generation
he was incompetent in prime time
he was metoo
he was really good i tell you
he was terrible
he was wrong
he will go home early
he will not get to 270
he will not get to 270
he won by nine points
he would end our travel ban to jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by listen to this over 700%
he's a hopeless poor guy
he's a real beauty
he's always talking about 
he's another beauty
he's been there for years and years and now he should have done
he's dead
he's doing very poorly with the black community hispanic community
he's going to do whatever they tell him to do
he's got guys around him that are pretty smart
he's got one of them
he's got one of them
he's great
he's never going to do anything
he's never going to do anything
he's saying

i agree
i also recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
i always heard they were going to catch us by 2019 for 10 years
i announced that i'm signing a law that anybody that knocks down a monument or a statue gets 10 years in jail
i appreciate it
i came here and they were going to close that plant in lima
i didn't close
i didn't even know it was closed
i didn't know him
i don't feel like a politician
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know if they had a contract where they could fire him but they hired this guy
i don't know what it is
i don't know why the hell he said it to be honest with you
i don't think it's socialism
i don't think so
i don't want to have a problem with men
i don't want to make the men too angry
i don't want to say it
i ended a regulation that will destroy suburbia
i felt sorry
i felt sorry for him
i go home
i got nominated
i got rid of the regulation from obama biden that was destroying suburbia
i had a news conference we announced it
i had called up the commissioner very good guy and i said 
i hate to say it
i hate to see what happened and it had a big impact on the market today because it was a bad thing
i have 28 people now that have come forward saying it's a total lie they don't care so they did an ad once they did that i said 
i have an idea
i just came into that big beautiful place
i just gave that up
i just left the great state of texas and i talked to a lot of people like this a great crowd of people
i just saw that we're tied in ohio
i kept 
i kept my promise recognized the true capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
i know it well westchester county the suburban they sometimes if you say suburban housewife you're in deep trouble
i love ohio
i love ohio
i love you
i love you too
i mean as far you can't see it
i mean honestly it could be anyone
i mean in all fairness it's like this everyone
i mean it was
i mean she started off good
i mean the whole thing is crazy
i mean they all want to do it
i mean we're going to be announcing it on friday or saturday
i never heard it
i never saw anything like it
i proudly signed the brand new us-mexico-canada agreement in july
i really mean it
i really think in many ways it's communism we're talking about
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i say to the first lady 
i see the signs 
i speak to the governor
i swear
i tell you i said 
i think it's a step beyond what they're talking about
i think military maybe
i think suburbia has got to wake up because if they get in you know who's in charge
i think the biggest ever
i think they'll get rid of her quickly
i think they're all open now
i think we are
i think we are
i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's rampant theft of ohio jobs
i understand from bob paduchik you know bob
i used to say 
i want them to do that
i want to congratulate you
i want to thank all of those schools
i want you back in ohio
i was down at all of them on the day of election
i was going to lose all nine and then guess what
i was like this
i was nominated
i was nominated not once but twice for totally separate events by different people
i was told by bob and some of the congressmen that are here we have some great ones i'm going to introduce them in a second but i was told that they're not even trying for ohio
i wasn't running
i watched
i watched them running through the crowds with those flags
i wish we could move the press back further if you want to know the truth
i withdrew from last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal
i won every one of them
i would say probably 30 minutes
i'll tell you i got this man
i'll tell you that was designed to hurt our country
i'll tell you the community that's most hurt most hurt by what they're doing and there is the black community the hispanic community
i'll tell you what
i'll tell you what you like the word pronounced lima or lima because i saved lima
i'll tell you when i do it and when i don't
i'm a real estate developer
i'm also proud that we have successfully brought back the big 10 and the ohio state buckeyes
i'm going to do it
i'm going to get killed for this one but we're going to terminate
i'm going to look forward to it
i'm just saying they have not been able to find in the history of politics in this nation even we loved ronald reagan but they have not been able to find where people broke out and said 
i'm not going to be able to call them back
i'm talking about you
i'm telling you
i'm the only thing standing between you and chaos i'm telling you
i've already signed it into law
i've been to a lot of different speeches and rallies
i've never heard crowds go 
i've only been here three and a half years
i've shown a list i have a double list about 45 from which i will only pick but he doesn't want to do that because if you found out who he was going to pick he would be unelectable
if biden and the left gain power they will dismantle police departments nationwide
if biden got in they will destroy the suburbia
if he did that he would lose the left
if he does something even towards left of center which would be acceptable i guess we have no choice
if he puts forth a highly qualified candidate we will impeach him
if i get in you've got it
if i were him i'd sort of either ride it out or stay with the good trump economy and get even richer
if it were up to sleepy joe bin laden and soleimani would be alive today isis would be on a rampage iran would control the middle east and china would be the dominant power anywhere in the world
if joe biden and the democrats take power they will pack the supreme court with far left radicals who will unilaterally transform american society far beyond recognition
if they have other problems that's what it really affects
if we didn't do that you would have had three million people
in 2018 we expanded the senate majority
in a second term i will provide school choice to every parent in america
in fact we did so well last night on one poll they said it must be a typo
in god we trust
in my first three years we lifted 6
in other words ohio state
in play
in the meantime china didn't kick in for another 10 years
in the meantime we're president and they're not
in three and a half years under my administration we've secured america's borders rebuilt the awesome power of the united states military obliterated the isis caliphate 100% fixed our disastrous trade deals and brought jobs and factories back to the great state of ohio
including one who attempted to murder a police officer and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight year old child
increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities
india is second with 38th and they have 1
is it going good
is that okay
is your arm okay
isn't it amazing the way it all works
isn't it beautiful
isn't that nice
it could go either way
it got to lincoln
it looked like we had seven schools eight schools
it makes a difference
it must be an error
it was a fake ad just like the ad on the grave sites and that allows me to say that this man is a gross incompetent
it was a much less lethal disease and they lost many many people
it was a perfect phone call
it was done
it was like right at the very beginning
it was so bad
it was the biggest story i've ever seen
it was totally incompetently
it wasn't
it will be a woman
it would have been terrible
it would take us 15 minutes to solve the problem
it's a big deal for our country right
it's a great state
it's a really rough thing in ohio but now we're talking texas
it's all of us
it's all of us have won
it's amazing the way
it's an amazing thing
it's blowing their minds
it's blowing their minds but for the people of ohio this is what you want
it's called disinformation
it's called the h1n1
it's called the opposite of what the fact is
it's crazy it's crazy
it's exciting even from me
it's going to be announced the numbers just before the election
it's going to cut your bills down to a level that you wouldn't believe
it's going to go quickly
it's got more televisions in any plane in history
it's just like a bunch of stiffs
it's never happening
it's no error
it's not that long ago right
it's okay
it's positive for their ratings
it's really a good thing but they don't want to do it but i give up on it
it's so easy
it's so sad
it's suppression polls
it's terrible anyway
it's true
it's true
it's very interesting
it's very interesting that ad it's very interesting
it's very simple
it's working out great
it's working out great too
it's you
jared and brady thank you for supporting the heroes in our law enforcement
jared bentley and brady williams who were recently suspended from their high school football team after displaying flags in support of our police and first responders on the anniversary of september 11th attacks
jeep
joe biden has refused to list the names of his potential justices because he knows they're too extreme to withstand any form of public review

once i got it going got it built i got the financing we won a lot of lawsuits by the way we won a lot of lawsuits
once it was obvious that we won and we started building they never talk about the wall anymore
once we started building it if you think that was easy to build the wall we had an entire party that would die for the fact and i made a terrible mistake in the wall instead of telling you 
one of them blue and a teacher's union
our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs including 1
our energy independence is incredible
our military might has never been like it is right now because of what we've done
out of the pledge of allegiance the democrats
peace peace peace
pelosi was suing us
pennsylvania every one of them
people are so tired
people are so tired of her
people that weren't even thinking about it they're going to say 
perfect
place would go crazy i should have said 
please don't do it
please don't do it
please have him call me back me
please please don't tell it
president please don't do it
president trump is going to go home early but it wasn't president at that time it was just donald trump
prison's a tougher word
probably announced the person
probably more than a million
probably saturday we will announce the nominee and it's somebody that you're going to have great respect for great respect
probably that is everybody's going to come to the united states
proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
put in other language they will end your second amendment
qasem soleimani is dead
real stiffs
really great job
remember
remember
remember
remember he calls it the n1h1
remember i said that jokingly and cnn said 
remember last time they said 
remember that
remember the one she was crying
remember they said first of all i wasn't running
remember what i told you about the monuments
representative bob latta
right
right
right
robert thank you
s
s
s
secret service is thrilled about this
see he didn't keep his campaign promise
see these young kids can hop over the fence like it's nothing
she goes 
she hits him with about 30 different things and i'm not talking about our president
she wants me to do it
she was crying
she was heading down to the basement
she was so mean to him
she was the most failed candidate
she's unbelievable
should i
should i tell it or not
since i signed a little law they were ripping down a lot of statues about four months ago and i said 
since my election natural gas production in ohio has surged 63%
sir sleepy joe biden did an ad that you
sir there was a law from quite a while ago 10 years in prison
sir we have one sir
sleepy joe biden
sleepy joe biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax site ban american energy destroy the suburbs give free healthcare to illegal aliens
so 10 years
so enjoy the football enjoy it
so get your friends get your family get your neighbors get your co-workers get everybody and get out and vote
so he doesn't want to show who his judges are
so he wouldn't be able to survive a joe biden
so he's going to have to put in radicals
so here's the thing
so i brilliantly said 
so i go home to our great first lady
so i overrode the generals i overrode everybody and now we're making a record number of tanks in that plant and it's absolutely thriving
so i say this it's called now 
so i think the suburban women and suburban men and husbands and wives and everybody you better get smart because you're not going to have your dream very much longer if they get in
so i turned on nbc with lester holt another beauty
so i want to thank the commissioner
so i was nominated for the nobel peace prize
so in a single term single term by the end of our term we will have nominated and had confirmed i think it'll end up being over 300 federal judges and hopefully three supreme court justices
so in concluding over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end the reliance this ridiculous crazy reliance on china and all of these far away lands once and for all
so instead they burned down portland
so is our nation mourns the loss of supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg i will soon announce a nominee for the united states supreme court
so it looks like we're going to have three and it's going to be very exciting
so it's good
so much evolves around ohio and it's just a state that we have a relationship with
so nobody's done it and that's why i think this is going to be the most important of all
so remember that
so she called them everything from a racist to a metooer
so somebody in the fake news media did a story yesterday because there's crazy chances going on
so they don't want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far left radicals
so they impeached me for perfect phone call
so they were having a big march on washington in two days and i signed this new law
so they weren't going to come in they were actually looking to knock down the statue of a man named thomas jefferson
so think of that 16 years
so we appreciate it very much
so we had seven swing states last time
so we're going to get it all changed around
so we're going to put up our nominee who's going to be outstanding
so we're up to 330 miles of wall
so what you do is you say suburban women they love me
socialism's no good
some presidents they never get any
somebody said 
sorry darling
speaking about warriors we're also joined tonight by some great great congressmen who are warriors and they represent ohio so well and they love you and they love our country

that was another rip off of our country
that was not good
that was the end of it
that we went home early as victors but we had nine states
that we're going to win it by more than we did
that would be gone

that's what he's going to do drain your medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants
that's what they want
that's what they're doing
that's what's happening
the army corps of engineers were great
the authorities awaiting and watching
the biden agenda would obliterate our economy
the biden nominated justices will shred our second amendment eliminate the right to self defense and allow the government to confiscate your privately owned firearms
the democrat party's war on cops has already led to a surge in vicious murders in democrat control cities costing countless black lives
the democrats formed it was very tough but i got it

then they closed the polls
then they got there there was a lot of pressure put on them
then they hit gandhi
then they said 
then they say donald trump is the projected winner by a lot
then we have a crowd like this
then you have the election night doing very poorly with those with diploma without diploma college phds
there are really no protests here
there'll be open
there's got to be feels like madison square garden on the ground except we have more people
there's no law and order no cash bail no anything

they never turn the cameras around ever
they opened the polls
they paid $150 billion plus $1
they paid him millions because he never predicted wrong
they said 
they said 
they said it last time too that texas is even four years ago
they say it's the most important thing a president can do
they say well what happened is he did very well with women did very well with men diplomas
they set the course of our country for many years to come whether it's on life or the second amendment or so many other things they set the whole course of the country
they should have called us in about seven days earlier
they shouldn't have allowed it to happen china
they sued us

this is what you should do
this person that's a judge of a union said that
this state lost one in three manufacturing jobs after the nafta and china disasters

african american youth unemployment has reached an all time low in the history of our country
after they spied we won
after years of building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country
again i really ran because of nafta
all of a sudden we're winning all these cases
all of the radical democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late-term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth
all over the place
almost from the beginning
also i call them warriors because they fought like hell
am i finished
america is no longer for sale
america is thriving like never before
america lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of nafta the worst deal ever made worst trade deal ever made and one that was almost as bad and gave china an entrance into being a rocket ship when they entered the world trade wto
america's no longer for sale
an american patriot
and america is respected again respected like never before
and arizona republican party state chair kelly ward
and by the end it didn't look too good
and by the way ohio we won by one of the largest margins ever
and by the way we're trying to get rid of obamacare but we're managing it incredibly but we're trying to get rid so we can give you a great healthcare plan and protect preexisting conditions
and don't let them try and take credit because if they came in we would have ended up in a massive recession or worse the d word depression
and for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
and happily
and he loves this country
and he's a friend of mine
and he's going to say 
and i asked my son don to get a couple of hats and get some things and give them to erwin right now
and i hear he's getting pounded tonight
and i hear i hear i don't want to say it
and i said 
and i want to thank you
and i was even told but a lot of people didn't want to talk about it
and i'll look at doug ducey and i'll say 
and i'll tell you maybe bigger than even the tax cuts and i did it sooner were the regulation cuts
and if you beat him in golf he'll try and beat you physically
and in the senate it was 52 and-a-half to a half
and it was like this massive number right
and kimberly
and ladies and gentlemen of arizona the best is yet to come
and mini mike just spent $500 million
and not that i was happy about that because i disagree with it
and now they have a new member of the crew mini mike
and now we're up a lot more than we were up even then because you know why
and one maine has one
and remember this we're paying interest
and rnc co-chairman tommy hicks
and she panicked
and she's working with me to strengthen our military still further and lower your prescription drug prices
and thank you for the great job you've done
and that is why millions of registered democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement
and that was my honor
and that's what we're getting
and the fake news can attest to it because if they thought i was saying the wrong thing it'd be out there immediately
and the fake news doesn't want to tell you that
and the luck we are having we are saving so many lives
and the people of arizona are going to love it
and then that beautiful convention center the most beautiful stage i've ever seen
and then the numbers started coming in
and then they came out 225000 the market goes up again
and then they said the evening of the election 
and then we won
and they knew something was going on because they didn't pay the final payment for the fireworks two weeks before
and they were right
and this year sir i'm up 92%
and veterans' unemployment has dropped to a record low
and we didn't pump money in we took money out
and we have a lot of other leaders but we've got to get back to speaking
and we immediately started
and we just took out the world's top terrorist qasem soleimani ending his evil reign of terror forever
and we live by the words of our national motto in god we trust
and we passed the spectacular right to try
and we were leading pennsylvania by so much that if i lost remember at 2% of the vote left if i lost every single vote i win by a lot
and we won the great state of ohio and we won it big
and we're going to have a new speaker
and we're going to have another beautiful night in november
and we're standing up to the defense of our constitution our freedom and democracy itself
and we're very importantly combating the opioid epidemic
and we've been doing it for a long time right
and we've ended catch and release a horrible democrat policy that we got terminated
and we've lifted 10 million people off of the welfare rolls
and we've set 144 records on the stock market in three years 144 records
and what we've done we've gotten rid of things that nobody could believe that was so bad for you
and when i took over isis was all over the place
and while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with the hoaxes we've been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages enacting fair trade deals securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race color religion and creed
and with your help this november we are going to defeat the radical socialist democrats and we are going to win arizona in a landslide
and you know what that means
andy biggs
andy biggs
andy biggs head of the freedom caucus
anybody
anybody doug
are we glad i ran for office
arizona house speaker rusty bowers
arizona senate president you know who that is right
arizona was founded by pioneers and prospectors great prospectors cowboys and miners and ranchers who tamed the wilderness braved the blazing sun and it is hot here
arizona you've had the best year the most successful year that you've ever had in the history of the country
asia's doing poorly
at stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation
because clinton didn't win
because despite the fact and nobody disputes it that we've done more in three years with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and the military and the choice and everything we've done more than any administration in history
because frankly if we kept the old practice which frankly some people could dispute one way or the other we would have been up in my opinion another 10000 points in the dow
because i don't want him to change
because i love this unbelievable energy in this crowd
because i love what we're doing
because they did the exit polls going out right
before i came into office the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country poisoning our children
before they're approved
bing bing bong
border patrol great people have seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever recorded in the history of our country this year
but anyway so then i go and i look
but doug i don't care what you say
but fortunately she's self-destructed anyway
but guess what
but he could have given you a great site for about $2
but he's tough to beat
but her opponent i have to say this martha a guy named mark kelly
but i actually think we're going to win by a lot just like we did last time
but i also took the strongest ever action to confront china's massive theft of american jobs
but i hear that in nevada
but i proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great american comeback
but i really believe we'd be up 20 points
but i think they spent like $ 2 billion on negative ads
but i was at 269 so i went to maine
but i was watching and they had an article this weekend about people that spent their own money and how they're doing
but i'm hearing that and i hope this isn't the case because i'd like to find out who the hell won
but if you don't mind i'm not going to criticize it tonight
but in the middle they have donald trump
but let's see how it all works out folks
but mini mike $411
but msdnc is worse than cnn and they're all pretty bad
but so in the middle they had trump and then they had four or five that were behind me
but some beautiful things happened
but that's okay
but the dnc is going to take it away from bernie again
but the ones on top they were absolute scum
but they had ross perot spent like 100 million which is probably double if you bring it up to today's dollars
but they look at us and they say 
but think of it think of it
but this thing was a dead newspaper
but under this administration the great betrayal is over
but we have everything we need right now
but we have some of your great warriors
but we just won 7
but we keep our promises that we work hard and our economy is great
but we're getting there and not pleasant
but we're going to have a big big election victory
but we're now putting america first
but with your energy and enthusiasm this november we're going to take back the house we're going to hold the senate and we are going to keep the white house
but you know she used the worst word
but you know we had great support from the republican party in the house
but you know what
but you know what
by a lot
by the way by a lot
by the way for people with the small farms and small businesses if you love your children you can now leave your companies you can leave your farm you can leave your ranch to your children and you don't have to to pay they don't pay a death tax
by the way speaking of that how did they do with their vote count in iowa
by the way the fbi those guys in that are incredible
by the way they turned away 21000 people outside so feel very good
by the way we just won $7
came down the escalator with me in trump tower a long time ago
can you imagine that
can't let it happen
can't let it happen folks
china had the worst year in the last 67 years
china will invest $250 billion a year into the united states and buy our products and create jobs

drug overdose deaths
energy independent
erwin julian
europe is doing poorly
even fake news cnn him on
even the democrats don't like him much
even this tough guy in the front says 
even though they were no way near where my area was
every ad was a negative ad
every day democrats' open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives
every year we lost money for years and years
everybody says to me 
everybody was happy with defending your right to keep your doctor and plan of your choice
everybody's working
everything was negative
feel very good
for the amount of money washington democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants we could rebuild our cities all throughout america which is what we should be doing
for the first time america is now energy independent
for years washington politicians took money from lobbyists global corporations and really the most corrupt special interests anybody's ever seen
from apache to navajo and maricopa counties
from our rural communities to our inner cities we're expanding the blessings of america to all of our citizens
from tucson to tombstone right
from yuma to mesa and from flagstaff to right here in phoenix we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded american patriots who poured their heart sweat and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our freedom
get ready november 3rd

how's it going
i agree
i appreciate it
i approved it
i approved it
i came up with the name pocahontas
i can give you the answer but right now they have to have a question mark right
i did it with the republicans and this could not have been done by anybody but me and the republican party
i don't care
i don't know
i don't know about that
i don't know about that
i don't know if he knows it but he's right now the hottest celebrity in the world
i don't know this has to be pretty good stuff on the debate stage
i don't know what's going on here
i don't think that's going to work so easily
i don't think the republican party has ever been more unified than it is right now
i don't want to jinx them because of course i want them to do well but i do
i don't want to talk about it
i don't want to talk about it doug tonight
i don't want you going to your governor saying 
i had a poll
i have a son
i have more indian blood in me than you have and i have none
i have to thank you that one
i hear a lot of bad things are happening like they don't know what the hell they're doing
i hear everyone didn't like me
i hear they're pounding him
i heard coming over here they're still working on the count
i hope you're going to be happy
i hope you're going to be happy because there are a lot of dishonest slimeballs out there
i just signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices those same prices fall very fast
i just spoke to some of your leaders
i kept saying 
i love it
i love maine
i love the phrase made in the usa
i love them
i mean all they do is negative negative phony stuff
i mean who the hell negotiated these deals
i mean you could get a kid out of high school
i never even heard of him
i never even heard of him
i passed criminal justice reform not the democrats
i really don't believe so
i recognized israel as the true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
i remember he said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said i'd spend a lot of money on my primaries
i see the results and they're happening faster than you even think
i should have finished
i signed that brand new beautiful us-mexico-canada agreement into law
i spent 70
i then went someplace else
i then went to california made two speeches
i think 100000
i think 84000
i think i win the bet
i think so
i think this guy's going to pull out
i think we did
i thought that was the problem
i voted for clinton
i voted for trump
i want to beat him
i want to start
i want to tell you it's seriously hot
i was at 269 if i did great but they said there's no chance
i went there four or five times
i went to maine
i will tell you that
i won it
i wonder what they talked about
i would have saved it but i guess it was effective
i would say he would have charged them $100 barron trump and it would've worked
i'd hear these polls
i'd hear women didn't like me and i did great with women
i'll give you five cents on the dollar for your fireworks
i'll keep it that way because otherwise we'll ruin the whole evening
i'll tell you he's tough to beat
i'm a deplorable
i'm going back home
i'm hearing bad things about their vote count
i'm not going to tell you
i'm sure it was nothing
i'm sure it wasn't
i'm sure it wasn't that she would become a supreme court justice
i'm sure it wasn't that they were going to extend her tenure as attorney general
i'm telling you i don't like what i saw
i'm watching the different returns coming in and i'm watching as much as i can of this stuff
i've been here during the summer
if they don't like that job they can get another one because people are starving to get great employees right now
if they had no money they'd go home and die
if you don't love it you're not going to do it very well
if you don't love your children it doesn't matter
if you like other nations that's great
if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november of 2020
if your children are no good to you don't give them anything
illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring
illegal immigration costs arizona taxpayers more than $2 billion every year
impeach the president
in arizona alone last year ice officers arrested over 4500 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery rape and murder
in fact do you remember the dog
in fact i went to the fireworks company and i said 
in new hampshire he did much better
in your state but you go to new england empty factories empty buildings
including as you know very well right here in arizona washington democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of american citizens
including over 60000 new manufacturing and construction jobs here
incredible achievement
irredeemables right
irvin thank you
isn't that great
it began in 2016 with that wonderful beautiful night
it comes in pretty fast
it cost $5 billion
it didn't say 500 million and it didn't say 250 like this steyer guy
it is
it just came out
it just flew away
it said 
it was 120 degrees out
it was 197 to nothing
it was a thing
it was shaped like the united states of america
it was supposed to cost $5 million
it was very late in the evening when they called it because they are fake they're crooked
it wasn't even a contest
it went to $10 000 per family
it will soon be almost one new mile a day
it'd be all over the place
it'd be all over the place
it's a good sign
it's a good sign
it's a much better story if i use it because that's the truth
it's all over tv that the folks here tonight have helped a great world war ii veteran into the arena
it's amazing
it's an incredible achievement
it's been so incredible
it's going to be a really short night for donald trump
it's great being here in the great state of arizona with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in god family and country
it's incredible what's happening
it's just like it was in 2016
it's never happened before in the history of our country and we can't let that happen
it's not
it's not even fair to the rest of the planet
it's one of those little problems in life
it's sort of nice
it's the best year you've ever had
it's the survival of our nation
it's too much governor
it's under siege
it's under siege
it's very simple
it's very unfair what's going on

nobody's running against us in so many states
none of your business

not that we did anything
nothing like it ever
nothing like that has ever happened before
nothing's worked over the years but this has really worked
now it's doing very well
now jobs and investment are now pouring into 168 newly designated opportunity zones right here in arizona alone
now our veterans are treated great
now they have the right to use our drugs before they're approved
now they're starting to pay us a lot of money folks
now this is your own money
now we've done a lot about it because companies are pouring back in
now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of arizona
of course didn't they say that president clinton when he went on the back of the plane was here to play golf it was 121 degrees that day
oh
oh that irredeemable's terrible
okay
okay
okay
okay don't worry about it
on no issue have washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than immigration
once you win money comes in
one of the big secrets
one of the worst deals that we participated in this
only negative ads
only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp which is vicious horrible ugly and evil
or 
our country is stronger today than ever before
our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring american liberty and cutting through job killing red tape like nobody has ever cut regulations before
our strategy worked
paul gosar come up here paul

record stock market
reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million american families an average of $2200 in their pocket thanks to the republican child tax credit
remember
remember 306 to 223
remember that
remember that
remember that
remember they built the $5 billion website
remember they said he cannot get they used the word path
remember they used to say a year before the election they said 
remember women didn't like him and at the end of that he did great with women
remember you need a magic wand right
republicans are fighting for citizens from every background every community and every walk of life
republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right here in america right here in arizona we've created 240000 new jobs right here
right here in phoenix an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood then walked over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he laid dying in the street
ross perot took away 19% of the votes
russia russia russia
same thing in new hampshire
same with the green new deal
see i'm being nice right
seven million new jobs since we were elected we were elected
she became this monster star
she hated donald trump but they said 
she helped us so much during the impeachment hoax she didn't wobble one bit martha mcsally
she looked with such indignation at the other side such disgust debbie lesko
she lost because she couldn't keep it straight on her own heritage
she loves me again
she loves to me again
she panicked and she had a test
she said 
she said 
she said 
she said she was an indian
she said what the hell is wrong with you henry
she thinks i'm a genius
she thinks i'm a genius sir
she was a real beauty
she wasn't
she's a great fighter pilot and a warrior senate
she's a phony
she's crooked as hell
shows what money can do right
since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47% three times faster than the increase for the top 1%
sleepy joe biden the other day had 68 people
so by the time people got into the voters booth they only knew one thing
so everybody they just didn't count that
so finally it's my great honor to introduce a tremendous person a great fighter pilot
so i won't use it
so i'm going to take all the credit away from your governor
so if you love your children it's good
so if you're in trouble and i hope nobody in this massive arena's in trouble but if you're in trouble you can go and get whatever the new drug or whatever where we have the best doctors best hospital best labs
so it tells you negative ads at least against me aren't so good
so many manufacturing jobs
so many that frankly we're never going to come back
so nobody knew what the hell she spent
so then it came in and then we won south carolina
so then we won wisconsin and then we won michigan because those companies now they're pouring back in
so then you don't care about the tax
so they go 
so they said numbers are looking unbelievably well for crooked hillary clinton
so this is truly an incredible time for america
so we're having great polls
so we're thrilled to be joined tonight by some of the best greatest
so what happens is this we're working on healthcare

that beautiful night in november
that border is clogged and we've started the big wall right in arizona
that is why in my state of the union i asked congress to prohibit late-term abortion of babies because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
that means a lot
that your 401ks are up 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%
that's a big deal
that's a big one
that's a big one
that's a hoax
that's a lot
that's a slaughter

that's how he's going to do
that's not what the founders had in mind
that's okay
that's okay
that's okay
that's okay
that's okay
that's okay because we don't care who the hell it is
that's one of the reasons our economy is doing so much better
that's right
that's right
that's right doug
that's terrible what he says
that's the way we want it
that's very good
that's very good
that's what it was
that's what they said

all the sheriffs got together they endorsed trump
all those phones they were wiped so clean
all those trucks that go back and forth
also a friend of mine and he wanted to just rip them apart i remember when he heard about it
also the birthplace of a thing called the american constitution
also with us our congressman guy russian reschenthaler
always got to be the two
always got to be two
am i a politician
america first
america will land by the way the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
american constitution
an older woman
an outdoor place and her husband standing there like they're afraid for their lives
and a friend of mine and a warrior
and a man that helped we just negotiated a major peace deal in the middle east
and as soon as i did that things went through the roof
and by the way it's practically expired
and comey said 
and congressman scott perry
and do you remember what i used to say that if they fight us remember people would say 
and he doesn't know we did a great job he has no clue
and he hangs up
and hillary got a subpoena on the 30
and his chief negotiator he never left
and hopefully we'll never have to
and i am devastated to see it happening but you see what's going on in europe again
and i figured i was going to be absolutely killed on this one
and i hope we don't
and i promise that i will pick someone like the people on this list
and i promised everybody i would never go riding in a bicycle race
and i said that 
and increase refugee admissions by more than 700% opening the flood gates to radical islamic terrorism
and it didn't work
and it was such a disgusting thing
and it's a good thing that they know it and i don't think we'll ever be using them
and know what they said 
and many many court of appeals judges but two great supreme court judges or justices
and now he tells us how to do something that's far more lethal
and now i'm going to say this make america great again again
and now we have something right through the runways the landing strips it was all grass infested it was all weed infested and now it's the number one space center in the world by far
and now we're going to get a third
and one thing you learned about politics i spent a fraction of the money that crooked hillary spent
and right now we're doing it again
and she's got them
and that's why never never i see his say hire american
and the democrats said 
and the drug companies are going after me with those ads
and the man right there jared the abuse the abuse he takes but he did something that nobody's been able to do and he wants none of the glory he'd rather not come up here
and the newspapers and the press and the fake news they went and said 
and the only time he left the table is to go on a bicycle ride and he crashed and broke his leg and his arm
and then i found out he was a democrat
and then it happened again with elizabeth warren right
and then people say 
and then the guys that were doing the investigation they have their 31 different phones they were accidentally wiped clean
and then they say 
and then we catch them spying on our campaign
and then you have this guy mike bloomberg mini mike one question and he was gone
and these are great companies that are doing it
and they found a couple of them
and they go in there they just start swinging
and they put our nation through turmoil
and they used the intelligence agencies of our country to try and steal an election and to try and do a coup
and they were all great great judges for the most part i think almost entirely but judges and really respected conservative believers in our country solid incredible people
and they'll explain it to him
and they're right because they will set policy for 50 years and they'll set policy whether it's life whether it's second amendment
and think of this for 16 years presidents obama president bush household income rose $2945
and this is true
and together with the incredible people of pennsylvania we will make america wealthy again
and we appreciate because mexico has been working with us very closely
and we are making it greater greater greater than ever before
and we did that over a very short period of time
and we have rich guys sending up rockets elon and others
and we have the most secure border in terms of drug trafficking trafficking coming along and we've done phenomenally well
and we just made a deal with bahrain and uae united arab emirates and israel and it's a great thing
and we went through the insurance policy and we caught them
and we will live by the timeless words in our national motto in god we trust
and we will make america great again
and we'd like to ask him
and we're going to further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs
and we're going to keep it there
and what about this kamala
and what he did his own man that was in charge said recently 
and yes we have a great relationship with mexico
and you hear the guy can't breathe
and you know that's hard when you have radical left running the city all politicians the mayor
and you know what i'm so proud i did it and people get it
and you know what the people that understand the smart people they said 
and you would think he would have joined our party
and you're going to see numbers and reductions like you've never seen
any state new york's finest
anybody you know what i'm talking about
anytime you see an ad from a drug company just remember one thing your drug prices are coming down
are your churches still closed
as he's getting rocks and cans of tuna fish
as our economy reopens i want to ensure that americans are first in line to get the great jobs and the high wages
ban american energy which means what
ban school choice and all charter schools they're very important
because for a while it was way under two
because he can only put super radical left judges on people that would destroy our country people that would destroy your country
because i watched him so badly he performed so badly in the debates and then with bernie he was average not great but he got through and i said 
because i'm here to block
because if they let you do what you do better than anybody else in the world you wouldn't have problems
because it's a little hard and i'm all for mask when you need them i'm up but when you're making a speech and the nearest person's like where you are and you're in a stage all by yourself and then he had a habit of taking it off and it hangs down on his ear as he's speaking it makes him feel comfortable
because that's a lot of the territory that we need
because with bernie he was able to get through
believe me
bernie comfort
biden shouldn't be asking for your vote he should be begging for your forgiveness
biden wants to flood the economy with cheap labor to replace us workers
blackouts rolling blackouts
brilliant
buddy was very good today
bumblebee brand tuna and you can throw it at soccer you can a curve on it
but a lot of people were unfairly treated by a bunch of treasonous horrible people
but biden championed every globalist portrayal of pennsylvania for half a century he was a cheerleader for the worst trade deal ever made by any country nafta and china's entry into the world trade organization which built china like a rocket ship
but can you imagine giving him credit
but coronavirus doesn't it sound like italy
but do you remember that beautiful day
but get out and vote early
but had she been loyal she would've left
but he always wanted to run for president and he tried before i guess but he tried and it was a bad experience
but he said 
but he went down and he didn't like it
but how could you possibly endorse people that hate you and don't respect the job you do and don't let you do your job most importantly
but i do wish they would show because it would be you know it's actually better for them if they show
but i know we're going to win so it's not going to matter
but i obliterated the isis caliphate which was all over the place
but i said to my people i said so if they don't believe me what i'll do is i'll make up a list of 25 judges or people and we'll tell them 
but i was in politics never
but i'm just thinking but i did it more in 47 months than he did in 47 years
but if anyone else said this there's a protection there's a dual level of justice but we're getting down to the bottom of it because it's not fair to us
but if i just did that a sixth branch of the us military that would be a big deal
but if you can spend think of this if you can spend less money and win that's a good thing
but instead he's trying to buy his way back in
but instead of endless war we are forging peace in the middle east
but it really is i appreciate it
but it's true
but just in case she doesn't we have an insurance policy
but listen it wasn't winston churchill
but my father taught me
but no no i didn't give away
but no nobody's ever heard that one before and i appreciate it because it is reciprocal
but nobody's ever built force like what we have
but now we're finally protecting our nation rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs our factories and our troops back home in the usa where they belong
but on november 3rd pennsylvania will decide whether we end the pandemic defeat the virus and return to record prosperity just like we were before or whether we allow sleepy joe biden who doesn't have a clue to kill the recovery raise your taxes delay the vaccine
but once they saw that i had it they said 
but stupidly i said 
but the fact is they wouldn't have written it anyway
but they are paying for it mexico's paying for the wall
but they never liked doing that you know
but they never want to show the crowds
but they're professionals they're anarchists
but trump raised substantially less money than crooked hillary clinton
but we caught him cold we got so much stuff
but we caught him we caught him
but we caught them spying all of that the whole big deal
but we got it we won
but we have them cold they spied on our campaign
but we have to include energy
but we should have closed a weak earlier
but when you look at it really it's amazing
but you know they're very smart
but you know what
but you know what
but you remember they went out and you had one then you had two three four then you had five six seven
but your second amendment would be under siege
by law they have to ask us to go in
by the way a big part of the american dream are minorities who made it and they want to live in the suburbs and they don't want to be next to a project
by the way i got endorsed by new york's finest
by the way november 4th they'll announce 
by the way the wall
by the way when not if when you see shenanigans please report it to your authorities
by the way would you stand up with that beautiful jacket
by the way you know the first ones that get wiped out
by the way your governor hasn't been so great
can you believe it
can you imagine biden if he won
can you imagine our enemies
can you imagine that
can't do it
come on
come on get up there
come on tell me
come on up
come on up here
come on up here
congressman mike kelly
congressmen glenn thompson congressman dan muser come on
conor lamb is just a puppet for nancy pelosi and crying chuck schumer

don't forget when i ran they said 
don't go out to dinner stay where you are
draft rudy
during the pandemic i've suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened american jobs
europe has almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the united states
everybody read it
everyone said it was impossible
everyone thought it was such a terrible thing such a terrible person
everyone's coming back home
everyone's talking about it
everything good
everything is perfect
eviscerating your state's economy you will spend a trillion dollars and what it is really it takes away your power it takes away your energy
except when it came to closing the border which i did which turned out to save tens of thousands of lives biden criticized me until two months later when he said i was right
first lady 
first of all i'm allowed to do it i'm the president so i'm allowed to actually
first they said 
first time they've ever endorsed
for decades our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations fighting foreign wars that never ended and defending foreign borders
for many years everybody thought they were going to win every republican
for me it's a very exciting thing because we found something that nobody would have thought possible
for years you had a president who apologized for america
forget about these things because you'll find them
frankly had elizabeth warren been loyal to her philosophy which is radical left socialism perhaps communism
from erie to eastern from altoona to scranton from harrisburg to right here in pittsburgh
from strzok and page two lovers
get me the hell off of this platform
get out of here
getting rid of that guy was a smart move but we caught him

i can say the same thing to you as i say in texas
i can't
i can't believe a president had the guts to do it
i can't believe you had the guts to do it
i can't imagine
i can't watch our president
i can't watch trump on television
i could call up every guy

i don't think of myself as a politician
i don't think so
i don't want to amend it
i don't want to be a politician
i don't want to bring it on but you don't see it much anymore

i got endorsed by oklahoma and i got endorsed by texas and louisiana
i got endorsed by the chicago police
i got impeached for making a perfect phone call
i got rid of a regulation

i use the word god
i use the word god because they refuse to use the word god in their pledge of allegiance right
i want this
i want to thank the president of mexico
i was recently honored to be endorsed by the largest group of police and police representatives in the country
i was told that a big thing when i was running last time nobody really knew me
i was with greg abbott
i was with ron desantis texas and florida and other governors that can't even believe a thing like that could happen but they get caught
i will only pick from that list
i will pick somebody that's on this list
i wish the women living in the suburbs would read these stories
i withdrew from it
i withdrew from the catastrophe because i was elected to fight for pittsburgh not for paris
i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal one of the great disasters
i won so much money we could build four walls if we wanted
i won't tell you why they're wired but they're wired for a reason
i wonder in the debate it'll be him and i or the stage
i'd love to have some but i don't happen to have any
i'll keep your jobs in pennsylvania where they belong and you're going to be doing fracking for a long time
i'll say 
i'll tell you did you ever see a better loser than bernie though
i'll tell you he's popular
i'll tell you rudy is amazing but he did a great job
i'll tell you what
i'll tell you what they work hard
i'm a blocking force
i'm a blocking force
i'm a reporter
i'm a reporter

i'm going to be we're going to have a big rating on that
i'm going to get one of those jackets
i'm just starting
i'm just telling you most powerful weapons ever produced we have and other countries know that
i'm like a lineman for the pittsburgh steelers
i'm not even sure that after some time listening to that and going along with it i'm not even sure the country can ever recover
i'm not sure it could ever recover
i'm such a bad guy i got travel bans
i'm the only one that's allowed to
i'm working my ass off i'm in ohio i'm in texas i'm in florida i'm in michigan i'm in wisconsin
i've gotten rid of phones too
i've never heard it
i've seen him before
if elected biden would destroy social security and destroy protections for preexisting conditions people with preexisting conditions drain your medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants
if i did just that space force big deal by the way it's going to end up being one of the most important things you've ever imagined
if they come back in we don't want it we don't want them
if they win sleepy joe if they win because he has no power over these people these people are crazed lunatics
if they win your cities will be like this
if you can win and spend less money that's a good thing not a bad thing
if you can win and spend less that's a good thing
if you don't love it don't vote for me
if you don't mind democrats will bring them the hell out of our country we'll get them out of here
if you have that the problem is we're going to give you healthcare they're going to all pour into the united states and our country can't afford it
in fact i was going to turn them in because they were right next to each other
in just three and a half years we've secured america's borders which makes them very unhappy rebuilt the awesome power of the us military we built the military
in louisiana we're building some of the largest plants you've ever seen largest in the world and it's incredible all related to energy but your security and your jobs are in very grave peril because the radical left maniacs they don't want to have anything to do with energy
in my first three years we lifted 6
in some places like i think in milwaukee they said no tear gas no pepper spray
in the old days my father would teach me 
in the second term i will provide school choice to every parent in america
in theory the democrats automatically win new york but i do phenomenally in most parts
in three years your household income rose almost $10000
incredible
incredible
inside those poles we have rebar and we have concrete and they're 30 feet tall
is he going to walk in with a mask
it can be stopped so easily and you guys know exactly what i'm talking about
it didn't matter to them
it doesn't happen with republicans
it goes on
it happened again
it just doesn't work
it shows the importance
it sounded like a penn state football game like the steelers football game
it starts on january 1st
it was 10 days late
it was a closed up mess
it was a disaster because nobody's allowed
it was a joke
it was a rip off of the united states
it was a terrible thing and should never be allowed to happen
it was a total disaster
it was actually 100 million to one
it was amazing how important it was
it was great
it was so easy
it was terrible
it was totally depleted when i took over
it went nowhere because they didn't trust it
it would maybe be gone but at a minimum obliterated they haven't touched your second amendment
it'll be a terrible terrible thing
it'll only be a few hours
it's a beautiful sight
it's a big difference
it's a big lake
it's a classic
it's a great you know for years though pennsylvania was a place that republicans just didn't win
it's a lot
it's a terrible thing
it's about other things
it's an honor to have you in the party
it's called respect for the office
it's corona
it's dangerous
it's dangerous for them but you know i'd see the camera would never move whenever where there's something like a little negative happening that thing would turn around like a pretzel
it's fayette county sheriff james custer and forest county sheriff bob wolfgang
it's got to be done so fast
it's less
it's like an anarchist's dream
it's like from 10 years ago it's like a different world and we want to keep our world the way it was and the way it's going to be
it's like i've lost a lot of people this way
it's never been this unified before ever ever and the fake impeachment
it's not a subject
it's not about money
it's not going to do it
it's not going to do it
it's not just about money
it's okay
it's our campaign and if you want to save america you have to go out get out and vote
it's reciprocal
it's record
it's respect for the office
it's so great
it's tall and it's strong and it's great
it's terrible
it's terrible shame
it's the craziest thing they love it
it's the perfect weight tuna fish they can really rip it and that hits you
it's the worst deal i've ever seen
it's their little thing
it's there
it's verging on communism right
it's when you have them
it's where the army weathered it's brutal winter at valley forge i know it well
jared great deal great job
joe biden has the support of violent left wing extremists
just call me donald
just come up
just every time you see an add from the drug company they got plenty of money that's why nobody ever fights them
just give a little hand because he's done a hell of a job too
just go out of here
just walked right through cleaned everything up and minneapolis was cured
last week after a police officer shot a knife-wielding assailant over 100 rioters rampaged in lancaster
last year i visited the shell petrochemical plant in beaver county pennsylvania the largest investment in your state's history
law and order the red states the republican states they're working great
left-wing radicals rampaged through pittsburgh harassing diners at restaurants
less right
let alone 31 different times
let me tell you
let them keep spending money on these rockets
let's bring him back
let's build it right
let's call up the middle east and let's be real nice to them because we need their energy
let's get out of here
let's not give it to him
let's see what happens though
lid
lid means he's not going to be anywhere today
like if you get along with the leaders of other lands and don't go to war all the time with everybody and can come out on top without having to shed blood all over the place and destroy your families and your country like when i get along with putin when i get along with kim jong-un
listen i want to become a republican
listen we caught him
long long wars
look he's a tough guy sitting here you too you're tough guys you don't want any part of it
look i used to think that was a difficulty like it was a new camera that can't turn but then whenever there was like a problem like there'd be a little argument or some kind of an anti-trump person you don't see that much
look nobody's been tougher on russia than me
looting businesses setting fires and assaulting police offices with rocks and bricks and glass
lots of luck

so i went back the next week i said 
so in conclusion over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on china once and for all
so it's richard on the phone richard my friend for many many years
so let's see what happens to these treasonous crooks
so listen 
so many different things but pennsylvania is the home of american energy
so many presidents they just don't have the chance and it's so important
so nobody knew
so now he's trying to buy into the party
so once we had the wall and it started going up and then we hit a hundred miles 200 miles now we're at 330 and we're building 10 miles a week and it'll be finished very soon
so the democrats said 
so the police all quit
so then they said 
so they don't like oil
so they don't want oil
so they went over the public
so they're not talking about that
so vicious so horrible and yet so beautiful and so historic right
so we caught them and that's called obstruction
so we keep them here we have no choice
so we'll crush the virus and our opponents will with him they will crush america
so we're going to make a play for new york
so yeah we're going to win pennsylvania
some of them are so violent we have to keep them

that one guy grabs a woman a older woman she's eating a steak
that sounds like a good reason
that sounds like an interesting idea
that was a 52 year development that i got done in about a day
that was a mueller group
that was a very good thing for us
that was all made possible by our pro energy policies
that was horrible
that was terrible
that was the mueller group
that would instantly shut down all fracking and all mining immediately in pennsylvania sending your jobs overseas sending your money to somebody else not you
that's a big percentage of the entire judiciary
that's a good thing not a bad thing
that's a lot
that's a lot
that's a lovely thing to say
that's actually true
that's all right
that's another beauty right there michigan's closed
that's another beauty right there that comey
that's basically saying you know what that is
that's because i didn't need the money
that's comey
that's even more impressive frankly in cash that's john kerry
that's great
that's great sean
that's how bad it would be
that's like one of many many things
that's never happened to a politician before
that's over a 16 year period
that's really great
that's really nice
that's so nice
that's true
that's true
that's what it means
that's what it means
that's what it's like really
that's what we're taking care of
that's why i'm doing a great job and i'll always do a great job
the appointment of a just weren't believing
the appointment of a united states supreme court justice was much more important to the voters than i thought
the commonwealth of pennsylvania
the cops in chicago you saw they're going like this
the coronavirus
the coronavirus
the crazy deal that obama made practically expired
the democrat party has joined forces with flag burners anarchists anti-police people they're extremist
the democrats in congress you have to see what they are doing
the democrats were just brutal
the never ending wars the endless wars
the number of hospitalized virus patients is down by 47% and virus patients coming to the emergency room is down and visits are way down visits to hospital
the only good thing about it is now i can take the gloves off
the only thing you can do is show
the radical left they don't want to say it
the real authorities they're watching and the authorities are watching but please report it
the republicans are doing great but they have to ask
the second amendment if i weren't president you know the pressure your second amendment would be obliterated
the wall is a tall sucker you don't want to get up to the top
the wall would get 10 feet taller
the wall yeah 330 miles
their dream choice
their stance on israel it's like a whole different world
then at the end of the phone he goes 
then he comes up with the mask
then i had the witch hunt that goes on forever
then one part it's automatic but i can't imagine that particular part is going to be very happy
then she choked and she went out and got a test
then they drop everyone picks them up throws them at our great police
then they have these fake ballots millions and millions of ballots
then they said 
then they'll say 
then you get a bill for $2000 for a band-aid
then you saw the first line
then you saw the second line then you saw a third line and then you saw a fourth line
there are other things involved
there goes 1
there was a chant that's going over the last six or seven rallies saying ‘we love you
there were amateurs
there were big strong guys
there'll be no more country
there'll be no more gas
there'll be no more industry
there'll be no more nothing

there're like 30 cans of soup
there's a whole great group of sheriffs and law enforcement here
these are a poll numbers
these are friendly protests
these are other police departments
these disasters ripped out one third of your state's manufacturing jobs
these guys if they fight back nobody's going to be there very long throwing things
these guys will come up 100%
these people are stonecold crazy
these terrible people
they all quit
they all said 
they always have to find something right
they are paying for it
they call me up and they say 
they came from a different locale and then you had a line of them and there was no social distancing unfortunately
they couldn't find that anything
they cut people up
they cut two young beautiful girls 16 years old
they didn't do it
they didn't talk about it
they didn't talk about the riots they didn't talk about anything having to do with law and order and respect and our great police
they don't have a shot by the way i'll tell you that but if they ever did the first ones that would get wiped out are the stupid people that gave them the money to do this stuff
they don't like god religion churches are close
they don't like showing
they don't like spinning those cameras
they don't like the gas
they don't want anything to do with they have different concepts right

and saying our present battle is the survival of the american nation
and that was going to be another benghazi
and that's what happened right
and the entire isis caliphate is destroyed and his terrorist empire and he was indeed a monster has been totally demolished
and the man who is in charge of my campaign in ohio i had a choice of five people
and these are people that never voted
and they get scorned and we take out thousands and thousands of ms-13 members every single year
and they got there immediately fortunately
and they make the tanks
and they run in and they're swinging and punching
and they said 
and they want to call them a safe place
and they were able to apprehend this terrible criminal
and they've been good
and this year's going to be even better and maybe much better
and very well we have the greatest labs and the greatest doctors in the world the greatest scientists in the world we have the greatest medicines in the world
and we are making it greater than ever before
and we further recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights 52 years
and we got it approved
and we start
and we will always live by the words of our national motto 
and we will make america great again
and we will no let them back in
and we will protect your pre-existing physician
and we will soon be replacing the disaster known as nafta with the incredible brand new usmca the historic victory for ohio farmers workers and manufacturers but really a great victory for the united states
and we won by a lot
and we're going to be expanding our military
and we're releasing them back to the community
and we've already built over a 100 miles of wall
and we've authorized 441 new striker fighting combat vehicles and 453 new abrams tanks to be built in the buckeye state
and when you see our friends and our great wounded warriors and our great warriors when you see them without their legs and without arms and with so much damage it's most likely that he caused that damage because that's what he liked
and with the great help of a lot of incredible republicans and we had some democrats help us we passed right to try and you have to see how this works
and yet now i see the radical left democrats have expressed outrage over the termination of this horrible terrorist
and you can have a country that goes to hell very very fast very very fast
and you could've never gotten those workers
and you know instead they should be outraged by soleimani's savage crimes and the fact that his countless victims were denied justice for so long
and you know the drug companies didn't like it because they didn't want to take people that sick because they didn't want it on their charts
and you know what happened
and you know what i'm talking about
and you saw this was the anti-benghazi
anybody that says that i said 
anything more fun than a trump rally
as a result of our actions steel mills all across ohio you know this better than i do are roaring back to life
as just one example right here in ohio you all know about it an illegal alien went on a deadly crime spree attempting to rape a 14-year-old girl
as long as we know that's all that matters
as the leader of iran's terrorist quds force soleimani spread death destruction and mayhem across the middle east and far beyond
based on my instinct i said 
because all of these things that we've done can be undone
because china devalued their currency and then they put a lot of money into the pot
because it's more painful than using a gun
because our country is doing so well
because they don't like raising their taxes and sending the money to faraway places that they'd never heard of
because together we will make american wealthy again
because we said 
because you know you keep hearing you cannot win unless you win the great state of ohio
before they wouldn't take them back
bernie bernie has gone up
bernie sanders crazy bernie has condemned the us military strike on soleimani the world's top terrorist think of it the world's top terrorist and we're having people like nancy pelosi that's a real genius do you believe that one
billy graham wasn't somebody that would vote and say he voted
bob how are we doing
bob let me ask you just out of curiosity i don't have these people
bob was fantastic
bomb
boy what a group but they're the leaders of the party
but democrats stand for crime corruption and chaos
but from honduras what about it
but he directed the recent rocket strikes that wounded four american service members badly wounded and killed an american citizen
but he leaks
but here's a guy who slaughtered and butchered civilians all over and military whoever was in his way and we have bernie and nancy pelosi we have them all they're all trying to say 
but i can't make it now because i'm trying to impeach trump i'm trying to impeach even though he did nothing wrong
but i didn't talk about right to try
but i have to now say do i want to change the greatest theme in political history make america great again with keep america great right
but i never talked about did you ever hear me prior to the election talk about space force
but i will tell you i haven't heard one thing where that was true
but i'm thrilled to hold the first rally of 2020 right here in the great state of ohio
but i'm tired of talking about this 10 months before the election
but ice offices worked through ohio police to remove one thousand two hundred dangerous criminal aliens from your streets
but it's true
but just think of it
but now they take them back
but our strong action paid off and we'll sign that terrific and fully enforceable phase one trade deal with china
but the democrats are taking their cues from socialist bernie sanders and that group
but they turn all these arsonists out including killing their victims with machetes ms-13
but they're losing and we're winning and america's comeback continues full speed ahead
but this is what happened
but under my administration we will never make excuses for america's enemies we will never hesitate in defending american lives and we will never stop working to defeat radical islamic terrorism never
but we stopped him we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold
but we were able to get bill
but we're ending the aids epidemic in america within 10 years
but we're releasing four million dollars of military construction funds to build the biggest section of the wall
but we've done things nobody's ever done before
but weeks ago i signed the largest ever investment in the united states military $ 738 billion and we created the sixth branch of the united states armed forces the space force and everybody's excited about that
but what we've done and he said he told me 
but while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the washington democrats are wasting america's time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts
but you know who the leader of your party is
but you've got a tremendous amount of dishonest media people like i have never seen in my life before
by the way did you see i did nothing wrong
by the way it expires so soon
by the way let's do one of those polls right now do you mind
by the way we don't want your oil or natural gas anymore
bye-bye i'm going back to washington
call me donald
can i get some credit for that
can you believe it
can you believe mayor pete
can you believe that abraham lincoln
can you believe this
can you believe we paid them 500 million through el salvador
can you imagine
catch and release you know what catch and release is
charter steel is building a 150 million dollar mill in cuyahoga heights and nucor is investing 85 million dollars at a facility in marion ohio
china is deciding not to buy anymore of this
china's didn't kick in until 2030 we kicked in immediately
china's very big
choice and accountability you know what accountability is
come on in
come on in
crooked hillary spent three or four times more
did i have something to do with it
do we love law enforcement by the way
do you ever see these crazy polls that come out
do you know why
don't ask
don't forget it's a long way to the election
don't forget president bush eight years $450
don't say that
don't worry sir you're going to win
donald trump gets to be a pinocchio again
donald trump is playing golf today
drug dealings all over the place
economically our country is the strongest it's ever been
everybody believed me
far left radical politicians support deadly sanctuary cities and demonstrated their contempt scorn and disdain for everyday americans and the american family
federal authorities recently discovered and rounded up more than 25 ms-13 gang members in central ohio
first lady i just beat abraham lincoln in a poll
first make america great again
folks you got to pay your bills
for 44 years they tried to get accountability
for years the sadistic mass murderer qasam soleimani planned and executed attacks against american targets killing and wounding thousands of us service members and many many thousands and even hundreds of thousands of other people
for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
franklin graham said billy graham maybe the greatest of all maybe the greatest of all time he said 
from cleveland to cincinnati from dublin to dayton and from columbus to toledo this state is the home of proud families and farmers and miners and manufacturers and aviators and astronauts
gee adam how are you doing
gee now i sort of understand why they hate me

how would you like to go into texas and say 
i actually it was all closed
i always say 
i always say i can be more presidential than any candidate that ever ran than any president other than maybe abraham lincoln when he's wearing his hat
i assume that 2 300 years ago was cleaner probably
i can't
i did it and i was applauded because the people get it
i didn't say that
i do
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know if they had polls back then but abraham lincoln
i don't know sir he disappeared
i don't know what happened to him
i don't know why
i don't want to do it
i don't want to knock it and then say 
i drive to play a round of golf at the course i own it doesn't even cost them anything
i gave some of that money because they were targeted to our farmers and our farmers did just fine
i guess he was right
i have an idea
i have more indian blood in me than she has and i have none
i have never had it win
i have now made his first name where's
i just don't want to tell you how long it's too long
i just left tennessee
i just left this incredible state of mine and i love that state
i know a lot about it
i like abe lincoln but when we're doing well we have a lot of support
i like it when they say 
i like this guy's name
i like your seat
i looked at how perfect everything was that turns around
i looked at some of the hydraulic and i'm i love all in the world tractors all of that stuff
i looked at the metal
i love it i love it actually
i made a deal
i mean crooked hillary spent three or four times more money than i have spent
i mean give me a break
i mean i'm here to tell you about the nobel peace prize
i mean i've actually completed more right
i mean i've seen it
i mean you wouldn't believe it could be that many but it is it's 60000 closed gone
i never said i was going to get that done we got it done
i never saw anything like it
i never talked about it
i really do
i really do
i recognized israel's true capitol and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said abraham lincoln i said who do you like better
i said i'm going to get killed on this one and you know what
i said there's no way i don't know if you know this story my people wanted 20 billion to purchase right
i said you know today we just hit the highest stock price in the history of our country
i saved a big war
i saved a country
i saved a couple of them
i saw what was happening and i said 
i say sometimes to france 
i see all those hats changing it a little bit but make america great again
i should watch
i spent two three hours talking to people who worked there
i think i remember the numbers
i think it might be the only factory in the whole country
i think it's great
i think probably more than that now
i think that would have been worse
i think the crowds today are bigger than they were the day before the election last time
i think you do
i turned out to be right
i understand that
i used to go around and talk about how everyone's leaving
i want to say great things about it
i was born to be president
i went back to the first lady i said 
i went over and i said 
i went through that plant
i will not use names because i'll be accused of something later
i won't mention the magazine sleazebag magazine
i'd like to say 20 years but it's much more than that
i'll be violating the carbon footprint
i'll never end it make america great again but i see all those hats
i'll tell you about that
i'll tell you i sort of hope it's joe because he will hear where's hunter every single debate nine times a debate
i'm adding in there the tax cuts which are tremendous $2400
i'm adding the regulation cuts i'm adding the whole package over $10000
i'm going back
i'm going to hawaii to play golf
i'm proud of this
i'm saying all this stuff and then i say 
i'm telling you i am such a smart guy
i've known this guy for a long time
i've known this guy forever
i've probably done this 10 times
i've taken the toughest-ever action against china's chronic trade abuses including tariffs on $370 billion worth of chinese made goods bringing billions and billions of dollars into our treasury
if every state is like tennessee sir i hate to tell you you're going to have one hell of a victory
if i drive 20 minutes it's like 
if i had to wait three days i think i'd like your seat better
if i were slightly off if it were if i was off by two factories there'd be a headline donald trump told a fib
if they have something that they're pretty sure is going to work but is going to take another six years i brought those times way back by the way way down but they would travel to asia they would travel to europe they would travel all over the world to try and get a cure because we wouldn't sell them the medicine because we didn't want to take a chance on making the people sick
if you do that you're going to shut down half your businesses
if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for and fought so hard to secure then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020
in fact it's so weak she doesn't want to put in the articles it's so weak
in god we trust
in october of last year us special operations forces executed a daring nighttime raid that killed the bloodthirsty founder and leader of isis
in three years
innocent americans are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals
is that a true story
is that good or bad
is there anybody from lima
is there anything more fun than a trump rally
isn't that amazing
it comes through the border this way not that way
it could've been done long before i got here
it doesn't help me to do it a year-and-a-half before the election
it doesn't mean a thing
it says trump pence and they've got buttons all over it
it should be debated
it should be debated rally it's a month before
it should be happening in about the next 20 minutes 19 18 17
it sounds simple but it was tough
it took a certain amount of courage to do that
it was a disaster
it was all set to close
it was closed
it was just in the papers today
it was put in there to hurt us
it wasn't like these folks today
it wasn't so easy
it would have taken many of your industries
it would have taken the car industry
it wouldn't have been as good as we have
it's a beautiful sight
it's a whole movement
it's an incredible agreement
it's called keep america great
it's called visa lottery
it's going to be for the record books
it's got to be something that's going to be special
it's incredible
it's iran iran
it's keep america great and that's what we're doing but we're going to use both
it's like my job
it's literally being signed now and will be under construction very shortly in couple of weeks
it's not a good platform but you have people that want to shut down the oil industry
it's not me it's we
it's really more than that and the rest of them are not going to be able to pay because the cost of this energy would be so expensive
it's terrible
it's true
jsw steel is investing five hundred million dollars in acero junction
keep america great
keep america great
keep america great
keep it open
last year alone ice officers who by the way are heroes
let the farmers tell me that
let's see you can do it
let's take a little applause right
like as an example many of you were here look at all those beautiful red hats keep america great that's good
listen we have the world's number one terrorist killed thousands and thousands of people
look if you don't take them back we're going to put tariffs on every single thing you sell
make it 50
mitch helped a lot
mitch mcconnell
mommy mommy take me home
most guys would have been in a corner with their thumb in their mouth saying 
most of you wouldn't
mr
my father billy graham
nafta i always say the world's worst deal
nancy nervous nancy
neuman
nine inches

no no
no no can you imagine
no no no
no stay back and vote
no they couldn't get them back
no they want us to call can you imagine calling crooked adam schiff
no they'll do it
no we got a call we heard where he was we knew the way he was getting there and we had to make a decision
nobody has ever done what we've done in three years
nobody knew that
none
nope get in the planes right now have them there immediately
not that i wanted to but we were ready
not too many people are watching cnn
now come on adam we got to meet faster on it
now he goes 
now i have a new theme
now i understand we're up by a lot more than we ever thought possible
now i'm a very loyal person and i am concerned about changing the theme because make america great again i think was the greatest political campaign in history
now it's a disgrace what's happened
now it's vibrant
now schiff is a big leaker
now the deal is done and the other deals are done and the farmers are doing very well
now the people i've gotten to know the government officials
now they go out they get a doctor we take care of them
now they say 
now they take them back
now they're all coming back new ones old ones they're all coming back and many are coming right here to ohio
now under president bush it was $450
now under the bush administration the $10000 that includes what we've done in terms of median income
now we paid them a lot of money
now you don't have to wait
now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of ohio
obama would go in and say 
oh
oh good
oh good come on over
oh there's not going to be any money anymore because you're not treating us right
oh they have some bad ones here tonight
oh we're not going to use that
oh would you do that
ohio is the place where strong american workers mined coal worked the railroads and forged the steel that made america into the greatest most powerful nation in the history of the world
ohio is the state that gave us american legends and american heroes like thomas edison neil armstrong and the great john glenn
ohio is where the wright brothers invented the airplane and where annie oakley got her gun
ohio lieutenant governor jon husted
ohio supreme court justice judy french
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay are you ready
okay these people here unlike you up there these people have been waiting for three days so that they could be here
omar aoc talib
on january 15 we're signing a monster a big beautiful monster $40 to $50 billion to our farmers
on no issue have democrat politicians more clearly betrayed the american people than the issue of illegal immigration
once i was leading ohio by a lot in the poll
one hell of a deal
one of the reasons they're coming in is we've eliminated a record number of job killing regulations saving the average american household $3000 a year
only in ohio can that happen
only in this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all
our air and our water right now is cleaner than it's been in 40 years
our country is doing so well
our farmers will be taking in i keep saying go buy larger tractors
our military is rebuilt
our military is rebuilt $2
our military was totally depleted
outside you have thousands and thousands of people that want to get in
people would wait online for weeks and some people weren't very sick and they'd end up being terminally ill
people would wait weeks
please come back in three years
please don't tell anybody i told you
please send us 200 tanks
president
president obama eight years $975
president sir how are you
president trump three years not even not even not even but three years $10000
pretty good warning system none
probably it's the number one reason i'm running
proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
radical democrats now have a party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
ready
ready
remember he had the cover of the magazine
remember he said 
remember i used to come out and talk about the polls
remember i used to say 
remember those great debates
remember what i said
republic steel is reopening the loraine mill that they idled in 2016
republicans stand for law order and justice
republicans will defend middle class taxpayers and the right to keep the doctor of your choice
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right now just in a very short period of time we've added 12000 brand new factories and many more are coming in
right to try you know about right to try right
s
sadly i can't say historic because you know a couple of hundred years ago there was nobody here right
saved trillions and trillions of dollars that was put in there to hurt us in my opinion
say 
see with the little red light on over there
she took over this party
shifty schiff and say 
sir it's great
sir none
sir should we come with you
sir the farmers can't produce that much
sir we have good news
sir we'll have them there tomorrow
sir we've been working on that for 48 years but we've never been able to get it approved
sir we've seen lines of people that didn't vote before because they never were inspired to vote
so $40 to $50 billion of agriculture product and the manufacturers and the car companies and we brought a lot of car companies into ohio you know that
so anyway but in honduras guatemala they have like this lottery
so at my direction the united states military eliminated qasam soleimani and ended his rampage through not only that part of the world but much bigger parts of the world he was all over
so he'll say 
so i did something based on my instinct because instinct sometimes works better than anything else
so i was president-elect i think right around at that time
so i was very very disillusioned but you know what i'm good at
so many people are saying that
so now he's gone and that's a good thing
so now we have south korea we just finished a big one $40 billion with japan
so our military is now stronger and more powerful than ever before
so that was something i did that i'm very proud of because i really over-rode a lot of talented people that wanted it to close
so they don't want me to make that decision
so they had this army tank plant right in lima
so they want us to call them
so wait just a quick story
so we are in good shape
so we built 100 miles
so we didn't do anything
so we have breaking news president trump within the next 20 25 minutes looks to be taking out terrorist general soleimani
so we have the government flying the plane all over trying to get a couple prisoners bad people back
so we seek friends not enemies but if you dare to threaten our citizens you do so at your own grave peril
so we signed that 11 months ago and what a difference that's made in terms of your lines and in terms of people's health
so we're using this great power not to pursue conflict but to really preserve and i mean in the true sense of the word preserve peace
so where is hunter
so with the va i used to go around saying 
so you now wait in line and a lot of times you'd wait in line for four or five six weeks you couldn't see a doctor
soleimani was actively planning new attacks and he was looking very seriously at our embassies and not just the embassy in baghdad
some of it's still coming in
some of them have been doing it for 30 40 years
some people are being many people are being saved
somebody else would go out they have all this money that they raised and they give somebody $1 million and they'll ask 200 people that question
somewhere you'll see it 
state senate president a man highly respected larry obhof
state treasurer robert sprague

thank you toledo
thank you very much
thank you very much for coming
thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border illegal crossing are down 75% since may
thanks to republican leadership america is winning again and america most importantly is respected again respected like never before
that is why i have asked congress to prohibit late-term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
that was a big thing
that was a setup for the united states to get fleeced
that was a tough one to get done
that was going to be worse than nafta
that was just before we happened to hit him
that wasn't going to happen
that's a long way
that's a lot of corruption back there folks
that's a lot of tanks
that's all they saw
that's better than a poll
that's happened
that's his first name
that's how they got into this impeachment on this
that's not a good platform
that's not bad that's not bad
that's not good enough but credit to opioid
that's people that are very sick terminally ill and they can't get medicine that possibly works
that's probably going to be the dominant theme
that's really a great fighting force but i hope we never have to use it
that's really the way it is
that's somebody bad works for the va you couldn't fire them
that's the end of his career
that's the way the academy awards used to look when it was successful
that's these guys
that's what happened
that's what they do
that's why like with the green new deal okay
the animal known as al baghdadi is dead
the day they came down that escalator it started
the democrat politicians we're fighting today are the same ones who took a sledgehammer to ohio jobs in factories
the evangelicals called some of the greatest pastors ministers preachers and they just called today five of the most respected people
the foolish iran nuclear deal financed iranian aggression while allowing a quick path to nuclear breakout that's what it did
the green deal i love it
the homeless they're not taking care of
the industry was dead
the leaders are not with us
the numbers is like a roller coaster down
the other one beauty how about that lottery
the people know what we're doing and they're tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world
the president is right and we're with the president
the problem is a lot of people don't remember alfred e
the pulitzer prize doesn't mean a thing
the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and the party of the american dream
the steel industry was dead and now it's vibrant
the trade deficit has come down
the voters of ohio will never let that happen never going to let it happen
the wall is being built
their policies are a disaster
then raping an murdering a 60-year old woman

you should come in and tell us what you want to do
you should get permission from congress
you wouldn't believe that it's possible but i know it's true because i've said it 50 times and the fakers back there they've never corrected me

a comment from joe biden
a great friend of mine
a hundred percent probably 25 incredible people any one of which could be a great justice any one of which
a lot of people didn't like that
a lot of people don't get it
a lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much
a lot of these fakers were with us
a man who praised and partnered with segregationists shift millions of black american jobs overseas and everyone else's jobs too by the way
a month goes by another month they never heard about it they never heard from me they thought i was serious i was and they came back at $4 billion
a vote for republicans is a vote for better schools better jobs safer families and stronger communities for all americans
above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america we will support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
accountability and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say
accountability we had a lot of bad people in the v
actually it's beautiful very old
after an hour we land we do some more inspections and they say 
after watching for an evening or two we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets
again they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television
air force one
all my life all my life i heard politicians want to lower taxes not raise them
all the money you owe us
almost $40 a barrel
also here is a man who's respected by so many
always always
america should not take lectures on racial justice from joe biden
america will soon be thriving like never before because ladies and gentlemen of oklahoma the best is yet to come
and a man who's got very good genes greg pence
and all of that incredible equipment whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters bombers it's all built in the usa
and all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time right
and all you did was keep your stock
and as i said joe biden opposed my decision and called it hysteria xenophobia
and at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation including a former member of the kkk and yet biden is now smearing as racist tens of millions of people like yourselves
and because of the chinese virus what happened about three months ago it looked like we were in big trouble and we were and i got it back together
and by the way most people said don't do it don't do it
and china's entry into the world trade organization was supported by sleepy joe biden
and every once in a while i'll have one of these days where i'm hit left and right left and right like even this great event
and everybody said 
and everything is going to work out for the young people
and explain this to the nfl
and he didn't understand that at first
and he frankly probably doesn't want to meet
and he goes like this 
and he said 
and he was jobless
and he's standing in front of a building saying 
and hopefully if you get out and vote we'll do it one more time
and i became president of the united states
and i did it last time and people loved when i did it
and i don't want to get water on the tie and i don't want to drink much so i lift it up the water
and i got it done with those people and your congressman your congressman who i'm going to introduce
and i hear i hear from your two great senators and your governor that we're doing very well in oklahoma that's the word
and i ran down the rest right
and i said to them 
and i think the numbers are worse than that
and i think we're going to have a big victory in the state of minnesota because they've had it
and i took the money that they targeted i took that money and i gave it to the farmers
and i walked off
and i worked closely with a great senator also friend of theirs senator tim scott south carolina to create opportunity zones which are doing incredibly
and i'd have an offer out i said 
and i'll choose only from that list
and i'll only pick from that list
and if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes it will be a whole different ball game
and if you see that happening if you see it happening on november 3rd you don't have the guts to vote against trump
and in minneapolis the council's already passed it
and in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem
and injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was
and it's going fast
and last night that had a little breakout
and let me tell you you think that was an easy one that was a tough one
and like our depleted military when i took over like our empty shelves medically when i took over like all of the things that when i took over it was a mess we have done a job
and look what happened to biden in ukraine where his son's paid $83000 a month
and nancy pelosi said 
and nancy pelosi they cut up a young woman
and next year we're going to have a good third quarter but next year and i said it before will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had okay
and now she's telling us how to run our country
and our approval rating at the v
and our country will never ever be stronger
and regulation cuts we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country
and representatives frank lucas tom cole
and she was right for south korea 250000
and since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment not government investment have poured into 9000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country
and so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week two weeks three weeks five weeks seven weeks two months
and so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%
and so you couldn't get it done
and thank you to vice president mike pence
and that means that a lot of people don't want me here
and that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see it was happening before this covid came in
and that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far
and that's true
and that's why they desperately want him to win
and the building is it looks like the biggest fire i've ever seen
and the great thing is with jim inhofe and with james lankford likewise they just said they love you james
and the other such way everybody's swinging at the end they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon
and the united states will be the first nation to land on mars good program
and then china sent us the plague thank you very much
and then he apologized a month later
and then the plague came in and now what we're doing is we're doing it again
and then they don't do the proper job
and then we say not only the world but actually in the history of the world and they never even challenged me
and then when i say the looters the anarchists the agitators they say 
and there's never been a comeback like we're making right now
and these people want to get rid of ice
and they are just incredible talented tough strong people that love your state a lot
and they came back and they said 
and they didn't cover it
and they don't and they don't want to report the way it is
and they never talk about covid
and they said president trump
and they say 
and they targeted our great farmers
and they want to abolish ice our great people from ice who send the roughest toughest meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard
and they want to appoint supreme court justices who will utterly obliterate your constitution
and two great supreme court judges
and v
and we are making it greater and greater every single day
and we could get a few more yeah we can get a few more
and we did something in minneapolis after watching for three or four days i called i said 
and we did the same thing in other cities
and we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel meaning you have an energy business again
and we have now obliterated we have now captured 100% of the isis caliphate
and we live by the words of our national motto it will never change 
and we shouldn't say this it's not nice
and we still i guess it's a i don't know if it's an equal court it's almost like we're a minority court right
and we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration that puts american workers first
and we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions
and what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment
and when i called them animals i said 
and when we have another four years we're going to have a big big percentage of the total number
and when you see those lunatics all over the streets it's damn nice to have arms
and with testing you know testing is a double edged sword
and with the help of our great energy workers many of them come from the great state of oklahoma
and you call 911 and they say 
and you know what that means
and you now see how important the supreme court is
and you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge
and you're not going to want to lose your 401k's
and your wife or your husband says 
angela that's a long time
anytime you want we'll come in we'll straighten it out in one hour or less
are you okay
as president i will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement
ask them how are they doing in brazil
ask them how they do it in sweden
at my direction early this year the heroes of the u
bad people
because he thought it would be good politically that didn't work out too well
because i can't fall with the fake news watching
because i don't want to pay 250
because i felt it was really good
because i said 
because i'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces
because when i was 10 feet short i said 
bent over like this
biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme too radical
biden is a puppet for china
biden is a very willing trojan horse for socialism
biden is always on the wrong side of history as said by people that are with him and worked with him
biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party
biden's supported every globalist attack on the american worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves including nafta the disaster of nafta
boeing says 
boy does he get a pass from these people huh
boy oh boy do you have a great immune system
but after an hour the general that runs it is a fantastic guy
but americans have watched left wing radicals burn down buildings loot businesses destroy private property injure hundreds of dedicated police offices
but democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter public private religious or independent schools of their choice
but he blatantly copied the speech of a british politician even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own
but he didn't say it
but how about seattle
but i really do i appreciate it
but i said because now they want to get cared but i said 
but i'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the united states supreme court
but it's happening
but now under president trump you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country
but she's in charge of the environment
but they always blame a president
but they said to me before the speech 
but they say to me

he exaggerated
he exaggerated he lied he lied he's a liar
he forgot to say he was born in america

he said with thousands of people that died thousands of people there was only one person that died under the age of 18
he supports sanctuary cities and now biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens
he thought it was a terrible thing
he thought it was a terrible thing
he understood i just saluted almost 600 times
he voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens
he voted for the war in iraq
he wanted to go and tpp would have ruined our automobile industry
he was a senator
he was a vice president
he was before that something
he was very proud of himself
he'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that
he'll recover in about 15 minutes
he's a great friend of mine not good
he's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight
he's been here for a little while

i don't believe the fake news anymore
i don't even know
i don't have a choice
i don't have a choice
i don't know maybe 45 minutes maybe longer i don't know but a long time
i don't think i want to take a chance
i don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came somalia
i don't think that's going to work out too well but she's actually in charge of environmental policy
i don't want that general
i flew in with some of our great congressmen who we're going to introduce it a second
i give him 100% endorsement
i got nicer apartments

i like the nfl
i look at numbers all day long
i look better than them
i looked very handsome
i love them i love them
i love this location the sun's like this
i love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas there's something wrong with those people
i mean i have a german heritage like some of you
i mean we're not talking about some little place we're talking about seattle
i mean would have been nice if we won
i never knew it was so deep
i ran for politics once just once in my life
i recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform
i remember when another president nice man threw up in japan and they did slow motion replays

i saved hundreds of thousands of lives
i say 
i say 
i say 
i say 
i secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities
i stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before
i think it's great
i think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name
i thought we won that battle with the nfl
i told them
i took a horrible deal
i turned out to be right
i want it canceled
i want to put him and jim jordan in a match together i want to
i wanted to tell that story
i was actually with a very nice man very good man even though he's very liberal the governor of new jersey right
i was really bent over too
i was speaking for a long time
i will only grab you if i need you
i will say this
i would love to do it it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back
i wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad
i'd give it to james too but he's not running this time
i'll let you know if there's something i'll tell you what there's something wrong with biden that i could tell you
i'll let you know if there's something wrong okay
i'll tell you what
i'm also announcing that i have directed secretary of the interior david bernhardt to place the john hope franklin reconciliation park here in tulsa on the african american civil rights network
i'm being baked
i'm being baked like a cake
i'm not doing it
i'm not doing it
i'm ready general where are we going now
i'm sorry this number's no longer working
i'm waiting for a call i would love to do it
i've already made one with china but i can make even more
i've always heard how important judges are
i've been saying it for a long time
i've been watching the fake news for weeks now and everything is negative
i've done more for the black community in four years than joe biden has done in 47 years
i've had people that i said 
i've never seen anything like it
ice they're rough guys
if i didn't come along we're building auto plants we're building everything
if i fall if i fall i remember when president ford fell out of the plane do you remember
if i lose an election over that you know what
if i'm off by two minutes they'll say 
if joe biden were to become president an emboldened left will launch a full scale assault on american life
if you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports the reports 
if you could lower him you couldn't lose
in 2018 alone our police arrested nearly 12000 people for murder and manslaughter 25000 people for rape and nearly 1
in almost every instance it ends just before i run and they said 
in fact he even put the big gun grabber beto o'rourke who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president
in god we trust
in joe biden's america rioters looters and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens
in major city public schools run by democrats over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math
in my administration we defend american citizens and we deport ms-13 members or put them in jail if we have to
in seattle you see what's going on there it's even worse okay
in that 50 day period it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market think of it
in the fall we got to get them open
interesting how all of a sudden people understand it right
iran
iran wants him to win so badly
is now 91% that's how good it is
is there like something else around
isn't that great
it had no handrail it was like an ice skating rink and i said 
it looked like the world was coming to an end
it really is
it takes longer than shooting a gun
it took them a long time to get you back
it turned out to be worse than anything i would have been better off if i fell and slid down the damn ramp
it was a great it was great
it was happening at a level that nobody believed possible
it was interesting to show you how fake they are you might've seen it
it was only an hour and 25 minutes
it'll be done very quickly
it'll destroy this country
it's a civil rights
it's almost like 
it's almost like we're a minority court
it's called the military industrial complex
it's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters
it's going to mean 250000 jobs
it's got to have a 3 at the front of it
it's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe
it's happening i never knew it was so deep
it's like the biggest fire
it's never happened before
it's not good for ramps and if i fall down look at all those press back there look at them
it's probably 20 million people more than anybody else
it's silk because they look better
it's so beautiful so beautiful
it's so unfair
it's this again
it's true
it's true
it's true
it's true
it's true
it's true right
it's very popular but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the democrats even though they know it's wrong
jim and james
jim and james
jim great job
jim inhofe
jim inhofe he's great
jim inhofe you better vote for him he's running he's great
jim is running on november 3rd jim inhofe
joe biden and the democrats want to prosecute americans for going to church but not for burning a church
joe biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob
joe biden is a shameless hypocrite
joe biden opposed killing soleimani
joe biden said and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph beautifully worded and i say 
joe biden will always let you down
joe biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal calamity and failure
joe didn't say that
joe doesn't even understand it
just anarchy
just as he opposed the raid that killed osama bin laden
just leave us alone build your wall just leave us alone
just remember i said and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much because it won't matter
just tell them i don't want the planes
just to show you how bad the fake news is so they say to me 
kevin hern great job today kevin

she has one problem it's called petroleum
she said

so did you notice in the end it was like 
so essentially almost 600 times
so far tonight but i call my wife and i said 
so here's what happened the bottom line
so here's what's going to happen
so i did that
so i end up saying 
so i guess i'm right
so i said 
so i said 
so i said they gave me a charge very early in my administration like how about the first week
so i said to my people slow the testing down please
so i took these little steps i ran down the last 10 and by the way their tape take a look
so i was bent over right
so i'm not putting any pressure on anybody but in the end we're going to have a phenomenal economy
so if you're a veteran for years and years they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years we got it done
so it's not going to be good for mayor bowser mayor bowser there
so last week they called me and they say 
so many of my friends have been asking me to do that
so many of my friends including these great politicians
so now i have a choice
so texas and oklahoma and north dakota and many other states would have been hurt
so thank you very much
so then i finish saluting my final salute i said 
so then my wife said 
so they came in and they came in and they said 
so they know
so they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from they pay billions of dollars to that country
so they said 
so they take over a big chunk of a city called seattle
so they want to defund
so they were even so they're okay
so unfair
so we begin oklahoma we begin
so we built the greatest single economy in the world
so we have two justices of the supreme court justice gorsuch justice kavanaugh they're great
so we passed v
so we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks which is fine
so we're going to do that
so we're negotiating let's see but in the meantime we're reducing our troops
so we're re-filing it
so what are you going to do right
so what happens is i said 
so what happens is i start the journey inch by inch right
some do actually but in a very sinister way
some people wait for four or five days
somebody two days ago said 
son walked out with 1
sort of like me in washington draining the swamp
south korea has done a lot
studied a lot of our great generals some of our presidents that went there
take it away
take your time
tear down our statues and punish cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control
tell me about that

that finally finally after all these years put america first
that happens to him all the time hasn't happened to me yet
that includes the senate and the house
that name gets further and further away from china as opposed to calling it the chinese virus
that party was totally unified against building the wall
that was a hillary clinton special
that was a hillary clinton special
that was another one for decades and decades they wanted to get it changed
that was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country
that was the only good
that will be a story too
that will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy
that's a case
that's a case add him to it
that's a lot of miles
that's a lot of money but i save like a billion six or a billion seven
that's already started
that's an all time record
that's been his history
that's called opec plus did you ever hear of opec plus
that's early real early the end of january
that's easy
that's easy
that's going to be very expensive for dc
that's happening too
that's incredible
that's not a good story
that's not good right
that's okay
that's opec plus plus
that's the word
that's what he says
that's what i look at for years now for my whole life when you think of it
that's what's happening that's what's happening
that's why they did it probably
the best deal you've ever seen
the chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities these are all run by the democrats is what will happen in every city and community and america and much much worse if we don't keep them out
the choice in 220 is very simple
the democrats want to raise your taxes
the democrats want to substantially raise your taxes
the democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe
the dems will also eliminate private health insurance ban fracking that's not good and american energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before
the forgotten men and women i campaigned on the forgotten
the great jim jordan jim jordan
the left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of thomas jefferson
the murder rate in baltimore and detroit is higher than el salvador guatemala or even afghanistan
the next week they said 
the next week they said 
the next week they say 
the recent supreme court cases prove that if joe biden is elected he will stack the court with extremists the forgotten men and women together with everyone else
the right to keep and bear arms we'll protect your second amendment
the stadiums were emptying out
the stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long
the stock market has been the best
the sun is pouring down on me okay
the unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history desecrate our monuments our beautiful monuments
the whole town is burning
the young man's 10-years-old
then i closed it down to europe early closed it down because i saw what was happening
then i looked at mine
then the incredible helicopters brand new gorgeous helicopters the apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that but i make this speech
then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news the most dishonest human beings they cut it off
then we're going to hit october
there are a lot of people that don't want me
there is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years
there was nobody that could have done the job they've done
there's no way
these are animals
these are great people
these are great people
these are great warriors
these are human beings
these are substantial people
these are super left liberals and they didn't like it
these are the elite
these are warriors folks
these are wonderful people anderson
these people are crazy
these people are incredible
these people are sick the fake news
these people are stone cold crazy
these people some of the people are waiting for five days especially in this location
these police officers they get injured they don't complain
they all said it
they are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth
they are they're great
they became like a rocket ship
they believe you can riot vandalize and destroy but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-america rally
they blame a president for anything
they call you a horrible person
they call you a racist
they complained never did anything about it
they cut them up
they cut up a young woman and her friend cut them up with a knife because it was more painful
they decapitated a statue of christopher columbus except in new york when the italians surrounded it
they didn't cover it
they didn't do too well in hurting christopher did they
they didn't have too much of a chance
they do a great job
they do some job and i'd have you come up but you can relax
they don't even know about this
they don't know what the hell they're doing
they don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people
they don't talk about when you see 25000 people walking down fifth avenue or walking down a street of a democrat run city you never hear them saying they're not wearing their mask
they don't want me
they don't want religion
they forget about all the money that wasn't paid
they get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals
they get it
they get rid of murderers
they get rid of rapists
they get rid of the worst scum on earth
they got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time
they have a better sheen to them
they have to come back because they have been fighting for us and they've been fighting for you
they haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying
they heard they were going to rip down their beautiful christopher columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing
they know the way it is
they like you people
they make speeches then i make a speech that lasted a long time
they mention the fact that you may have parkinson's disease
they pay us billions and billions of dollars
they put him in charge of guns
they realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders
they really do this as a serious movement
they said 
they say there is something wrong with our president
they sent young boys to fight in iraq while the inner cities crumble helped the big banks while hammering community leaders and made our cities less safe and secure for all

we're doing record business
we're glad to be joined as well by a man that i've gotten to know
we're going to be up
we're going to be way up
we're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for americans of every race color religion and creed
we're going to go up
we're going to refile it
we're going to stop the radical left
we're going to win
we're going up
we're going up
we're going up
we're lowering the price of prescription drugs making our allies pay their fair share
we're not conforming that's why we're here actually
we're not going to be where we were but in many ways other than all of the horrible horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated which was china
we're not happy
we're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it
we're supposed to protect them
we've all worked too hard
we've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the united states military
we've tested now 25 million people
well i know what you did
well it wasn't only the ramp
well they're not elite
well what about the last 25 years
west point is beautiful right on the hudson river
what
what a great senator he is
what a terrible thing for our president to say what a terrible thing
what about the trillion dollars that you really owe
what does it have to do with water
what happens is you go outside you get a private doctor you get fixed up and they pay your bill
what's wrong with having these great economic numbers
what's wrong with having to close it down
whatever but it was a lot
whatever it was if i'm a little bit off they'll go crazy
when biden first ran for president over 33 years ago remember i used to call him 1% joe he never got more than 1% until obama took him off the trash heap
when china joined the world trade organization they were flat line for decades
when i get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars nobody wants to talk about that
when i take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly germany is an example
when i took early and decisive action to ban travel from china and protect americans from the virus
when i took over isis was all over the place and i did something that i felt we should do
when rioting and looting broke out in our nation's capitol i very quickly deployed the national guard
when that happens there's nothing you can do to make up for it
when the chips are down biden will always cave to the radical left
when they hear it they get it
when we close the border
when you do testing to that extent you're going to find more people you're going to find more cases
when you see a little kid running around say 
when you see looters even though we put them down if we didn't stop them nobody would because the other side will never stop them
where did that come from in the middle of the summer
where do you get the energy
where's my senator
whether it's a young woman an old woman a young man or an old man and you're sleeping
which tells me one thing that kids are much stronger than us
why
why sir
with your help we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
won two world wars defeated fascism and communism and made america the single greatest nation in the history of the world
would you believe that
would you like to salute
would you sign for this plane
yeah
yeah why do you call them the elite
yes
yes i am
yes sir
yes sir i'm very proud of it
yes we think by and they say yes we think by 2030 maybe 2032 we could get current
yet biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation
you are so lucky i'm president that's all i can tell you
you are such a great investor
you are warriors thank you
you couldn't get rid of them because they were let's say it could be unions it could be civil service right let's say let's just say
you couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water
you couldn't sell it
you don't hear their say as they're breaking windows and running in
you even you you don't have the guts to vote against trump
you got to win daca
you had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive
you had to see what isis was doing
you have to understand i left early in the morning to get there
you have two great senators
you hear that jim
you hear that jim
you heard about sweden right
you know a lot of people say we should have gone herd let's go herd
you know in the end they gave up you know what happened
you know it
you know that
you know that right
you know that story
you know they talk about freedom of speech and i'm a big believer in freedom of speech but that's desecration that's a terrible thing they do
you know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister
you know what that is
you know what to do
you know what's great
you know who i'm talking about
you know why
you know why
you know why he didn't like it
you listen to the fake news they say 
you mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million
you might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster
you saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up beautiful
you take your time darling take your time
you try putting aoc in judge of your energy
you use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it
you want to see a lot of birds that are dead
you won but you have to come back and redo it
you'll send every one of them
you're drinking you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you
you're going to win daca
you're not going to want to do that
you're the elite
you're trending number one
you've always been a loser
you've always lost money
your whole country will be like that
100000 mississippi jobs were wiped away just like that and that's awful and a big price to pay for washington's disloyalty to the american worker
14 seasons
19 minutes after i took the oath of office the horrible newspaper fake fake fake washington post declared 
196 for and nothing against right
27000
33
33000 emails
33000 emails disappeared but she said they only had to do with her working out at her daughter's wedding
5 billion
5 billion to invest meaning he makes millions and millions of dollars and the biggest guys on wall street can't get it
7 million people and they were the ones the orange jumpsuits
a lot of good things are happening
about time we got rid of nafta
above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america
abraham lincoln
actually i have to be honest
actually they're sort of mentally violent people but we've got it under control
adam schiff is a corrupt politician
after birth after birth
after bleeding the middle class dry democrats threw open our borders to the world flooding our communities with poisonous drugs and criminal cartels
after years of building up foreign nations we are finally building up our nation
agriculture commissioner andy gipson
al green he's another beauty
all put to work
always
america is thriving like never before
america is winning again and america is all over the world respected again
american special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell i guess you could say
and a lot of bad people along the way
and actually and i'm happy about this conan the dog got more publicity than me
and all i know is he's loved and respected by your current governor because phil is some piece of work
and baghdadi he was a savage and soulless monster but his reign of terror is over
and billions of dollars will come in and we're protecting a great ally
and by the way for those of you with a thing called 401ks the stock market hit today another all-time historic high
and cindy hyde-smith has been fantastic
and cindy said 
and conan's coming to the white house in a few weeks
and do you remember he made the statement that he was born for this
and don't kid yourself
and former governor a man that nobody's ever heard of in this room i'm sure but the truth is he's a legend in politics and a great guy
and he came out of texas the great state of texas
and he looked at me and he couldn't really answer it because how the hell did this happen
and he looks and he goes 
and he loves this state and he loves you people
and he said 
and he was against oil
and he was great
and he's a nice guy and hopefully he's going to root out corruption because ukraine has tremendous corruption problems
and hello tupelo
and here's the good news
and how would you like to have sleepy joe with the son getting all of this money from china become president and take over the china deal
and i call a brand new person a man i have no idea who he is and i'm on a phone right
and i know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of country many people listen
and i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
and i said 
and i want to thank the country of mexico
and i want to thank the president of mexico
and i'd go into these offices; i'd see 10 or 15 of them packed up all over the place the washington post and the new york times
and i'd like to speak well but the leadership they have no clue
and i'm on the phone and they want me to say to this brand new president just got there called to congratulate him 
and i'm very happy with that
and if that's the case some really bad things happen because he made a total fool out of himself
and if they ever did anything bad if they ever do anything bad to us if they ever succeed in their wildest dream which will never let them happen that stock market will crash like you've never seen a crash before
and if you think you have a lot of people in this room all you have to do is go outside
and it's been split into $12 billion the year before
and it's not me it's us
and jill stein she's a greenie
and jim hood went to the united nations and opposed your right to self-defense
and just days ago the united states brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice
and ladies and gentlemen of mississippi the best is yet to come
and one day it's the times one day it's the post
and one of the reasons i held up money very important corruption
and our military loves mississippi
and president obama worked harder at defeating me than crooked hillary clinton did right
and remember the new president of ukraine is speaking to the united states of america the president
and remember this that truth is a force of nature
and right now our numbers are higher than they've ever been before
and roger has been fantastic
and roger wicker said 
and somebody i'll call her up because believe it or not she's running with me
and soon it will be when the wall is completed secure like it's never been before
and tate will always defend your second amendment
and thanks to our tireless efforts on the southern border tough place illegal crossings have dropped 60% since may and we are faster than ever securing the southern border
and that's not the kind of guy we need here
and that's okay
and that's true with many countries by the way
and the army corps of engineers is building their hearts out
and the media are continuing with the deranged impeachment witch hunt
and the reason is that our democrats won't even approve things called loopholes
and then by the way the following day we got number two
and then i have to defend myself when i say they're animals
and then there are other places also i understand
and then they figured they could take us out a different way very dishonesty right with the lying and the spying and the leaking
and they are keeping people out
and they came into my office and then i got to get back to this guy
and they know they can't win so let's try and impeach him
and they look at me like 
and they slice people up with a knife because it's more painful than using a gun
and they thought our farmers would say 
and they won't show the laughter and they won't show the sarcasm and they won't show the fun because they're the most dishonorable people almost on earth
and they're going to pay
and this is a very serious wall
and this young six-year-old is smarter so i think i'd basically go with her
and tim scott i give him so much credit from the great state of south carolina choices
and today it's greater than ever before
and very importantly we've confirmed more than 158 brand new beautiful federal judges to uphold our constitution as written
and we also need see-through sir
and we appreciate it
and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
and we are kicking their ass
and we can't let it happen
and we don't have to defend the borders between turkey and syria
and we had a lot left over
and we live by the words of our national motto and we always will
and we will make america great again
and we'll distribute that oil we'll help out the kurds and we'll help out other people
and we're also the party of abraham lincoln
and we're going to have a lot leftover
and when hillary made those statements two statements both of them 
and when i left crazy arnold took over
and you got to look at her district in san francisco
and you have great congressmen here and i'll tell you i want to appreciate it fellas
and you know what
and you know why it failed
and you think that was easy
and you will not be happy with your 401ks like you're happy right now because they don't know what they're doing
and your next lieutenant governor delbert hosemann
anybody that says he was born for this they're in trouble
anybody want to leave
anyway just to finish
arnold
ask china 
at least they gave us 19 minutes
at least we have a forum we have a place we can talk so everyone knows what's going on
because there really is
because they disrespected us
because together we will make america wealthy again
before my election our leaders used the great american middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects all over the world
beto
beto
better you than me
bigger than anything
blue springs
but again 142 judges he gave us
but before i say the final thing on hunter and then we put him to rest for a while we got rid of the washington post and the failing new york times
but beto was nasty and he said that he was born for it like he was born from heaven
but biden said 
but do you think when i'm making a call to a newly-elected president of a country that i would say something improper when i know there are so many people listening on the line
but he was the founder and the leader of isis and he's dead
but he's waving his arms and going crazy and i said 
but here's the good news
but i don't know jill stein
but i don't like that
but i said to him i said to secretary of agriculture sonny purdue a great guy; i said 
but i used to watch him
but i'll tell you the republicans are really strong the strongest i've ever seen them the most unified i've ever seen them
but i'll tell you what these are very bad people
but i'm asking
but if i were a democrat they'd be talking about that story for weeks
but in the very twisted and corrupt world of adam schiff after beating the entire political establishment and that means bush and that means clinton and that means obama they have me supposedly saying to myself 
but it is true
but it just worked out that way
but let me just tell you something
but many people are running
but nobody has ever asked before
but now you finally have a president who is loyal to you and i am
but over that past more than three years is finally being exposed
but sleepy joe i'm worried about right
but stacey abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote
but the media and the democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership trying to impose their will and to thwart american democracy by any means necessary
but the people here that are highly sophisticated though long before i won
but the wall is going up rapidly
but these same politicians poured precious american blood and treasure into the sands of the middle east while allowing our cities to fall into disrepair and decay
but they want to stop us because they know we are here and that's what we're doing and that's what's taking up so much time
but they were so thrilled that we got this animal
but think about the preposterous hoax the democrats are now trying to peddle
but think of it
but to be with thousands of incredible patriots who put their faith in god family and country
but we could end this in 15 minutes but they don't want to do it
but we gave the military a lot of money and we took it from the military and we took it from here we took it from there
but we said 
but we say it anyway
but we've now named him very slow sleepy joe
but what we do is we did keep the oil if you don't mind
but what you should do is take a look at the behavior of sleepy joe
but while we're creating jobs and killing terrorists the democrat party has gone completely insane
but with your help we will lift millions more of our great citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
but you have to reject their extremism and their socialism and their corruption
but you know what
but you know what
by law you've got to release them or they'll arrest the border patrol agent if they don't release
by the time they saw the doctor they were terminally ill
by the way did you ever see any human being treated worse than now-justice kavanaugh
by the way he's dropping like a rock
can you believe it
can you believe that
can you believe that
can you believe this
catch and release
china
cindy hyde-smith

compliments of china
could you call and say hello
crazy nancy
democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
democrats' sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets
desperate to conceal their misdeeds the democrats are now attacking us for calling out the grave corruption of the bidens just like they melted down when we pointed out crooked hillary's shocking and very many misdeeds
did anybody ever
did you ever see a story disappear so fast
did you hear
did you hear beto
do you believe this
does he ever stand on the floor and speak
don't mention it please
don't tell the press that because they'll say but one soldier stepped in a nail
done
ell thank you very much
everybody knows it and that's why we've never had greater support than we have right now
everybody laughed because of what we proved
first they engineered the russia hoax
folks it's disgraceful that the press doesn't cover it for what it is
for decades you saw corrupt politicians take money from lobbyists to impose catastrophic trade deals
for years you watch as your politicians apologize for america
four days from now this state will head to the polls and vote to continue our extraordinary progress with your next governor republican tate reeves
four more years
four more years
four more years
four more years
four more years

he came out of texas a very hot political property and he went back as cold as you can be
he goes 
he is smart
he is tough
he left us 142 openings
he loves the people of this great state governor phil bryant
he never spoke to him
he said 
he said 
he said the baby is born and then he starts talking to the mother
he should be there fairly soon
he spent his last miserable moments on earth cowering and trembling and crying in fear of the american warrior that was right there going right up
he then came out he did the morning show
he used to interview me
he walks out with $1
he wanted obama to win so badly and then he wanted hillary to win
he was against religion
he was against you having a gun
he was all over the place
he was great
he was pathetic
he was so nice
he was standing on countertops
he will be a great great governor
he will not be president
he wouldn't know what you're talking about
he'd do good
he'll be right at the front
he'll never let you down
he'll oppose sanctuary cities which is just terrible
he's a great guy haley barbour
he's a weak person but they're all weak
he's always there
he's an excellent person great man
he's brilliant actually
he's going to be a great governor
he's going to be fantastic
he's got total immunity because he made it in congress
he's gotten slower and slower
he's such a great
he's supported by extreme leftists like stacey abrams who by the way went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentlemen from the great state of georgia brian kemp
he's weak
hey he's a great guy too

i don't think he's ever going to have to and i don't think tate will ever have to make that trip
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think that he's going to be the right guy
i don't think you'll ever have to make that trip
i don't want to talk about their campaign
i got a guy named sleepy joe biden
i got money for everything but when it came to the wall not 25 cents
i guarantee he's got a lot of people listening too
i guess not
i guess they do watch us
i guess they knew we were going to win right
i keep trying to figure out who's worse
i kept saying 
i love alabama
i love alabama
i love our police
i love the people
i made it at the behest of people to say 
i mean even when we got al-baghdadi the washington post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric
i mean if obama had that story that thing would be going on for another seven months
i mean some of these people they want to give them education
i mean these guys are tough guys and they love our country
i mean think of that $28 billion
i mean you know they try and say 
i never changed
i never mentioned the fact that they're paying my son millions
i never met the people never met the gentlemen
i said
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said to prime minister i said 
i said ‘you're not getting a billion
i saw him i said 
i think the guy that you want is tate reeves
i thought she'd have six years
i told my wife i said 
i told our great first lady tonight who people love
i used to call him 1% because you could never get 1% in the primaries
i used to have guys come into my office 
i wanted phil to run for a certain office then i wanted him to do something
i watched this horrible guy who gets lousy ratings anderson cooper
i went to the border patrol incredible people and ice
i will always protect medicare for our seniors and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
i will give you a pardon if i have to
i'd like to apologize
i'll give you a one-hour pardon
i'll say 
i'll tell you
i'm a fighter for your jobs for your wages your factories your families and your dignity
i'm afraid if he gets a nomination he'll be so slow we'll have the lowest-rated debates in history as opposed to the highest-rated debates in history against crooked hillary
i'm talking to mississippi
i'm talking to mississippi
i've been trying to get an answer for four months
i've just beaten with no political experience the clinton dynasty the bush dynasty the president barack hussein obama dynasty
i've never seen it
i've tried to get him but some guys are confident
if somebody wants to go and buy them; we threw them out
if the prosecutor isn't fired you're not getting the money
if you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ice and border patrol vote for tate reeves
in a very short while we'll have 182 federal judges
in all the right areas
in all the right areas
in fact i don't even think that sleepy joe will get it
in fact so many they can't even tell me
in god we trust
in many ways they're better politicians but they're not as vicious
in my opinion it's virtually corrupt
in other words he said 
in the delusional democrat fantasy i'm now supposed to be afraid of someone called 1% joe
including 100 new opportunity zones right now in mississippi where money is now flowing in to build and to fix
incredible people
incredible people tough people
insurance commissioner mike chaney
isn't that nice
it also sends a big signal to these radical left crazy democrats
it always helps when you didn't do anything wrong
it didn't do too well
it doesn't happen
it is the job of our military to protect our security not to be the policemen of the world
it was called the apprentice and it was a big success
it was dead
it was dead from the first episode
it was disloyalty stupidity corruption lots of reasons
it was going to fail
it was heading in the wrong direction
it was like they were love fests but i don't want anything to do with him
it was perfect
it was totally appropriate
it was very very depleted
it will be easy
it's 63 million but it's much more than 63 million
it's a big signal
it's a disgrace
it's a great agreement
it's a great place
it's a payoff
it's a payoff
it's about time
it's all of us
it's amazing how cold you could get so quickly but he was a nasty guy
it's called a payoff but you know what
it's crazy
it's crazy but it's all beautiful the way it's happening
it's embarrassing
it's funded
it's going up fast
it's going up rapidly
it's great for you
it's like the academy awards before it failed
it's like top each other they're so bad
it's not the same country anymore
it's okay
it's reversed
it's so phony
it's the only time i've actually seen him work hard when it came to trying to beat trump
it's those sneaky ones in the back that don't talk that you don't know about
it's thousands and thousands of tents and drugs and needles and everything you can imagine floating in the streets in the best neighborhoods
it's too bad we get such good ratings because if we didn't they wouldn't be here
it's true
it's true
it's turned out he doesn't
it's under attack
it's very important for this reason as well as the fact that you have a great gentleman in your midst
it's very important that tate wins
just did one show
just let it be fair but they don't have that
king we're going to help you but you've got to pay
let it be a big victory too
let's call up ukraine for help
let's do friday
let's see who would do good
let's use ukraine for help
lock her up

look at him

make no mistake
many people
maybe he'll get better
maybe he'll get better
maybe he'll get better
mississippi
mississippi aren't you getting tired of winning
mississippi lost 40% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the world trade organization
most of you wouldn't do too good
much more
nah he went back home to texas and hopefully we won't be hearing about him for a long time
nancy pelosi go home and fix your district nancy
nervous nancy she doesn't want to give the people of our country a victory
no
no enemy stands a chance against the righteous bite of the united states military and mississippi loves our military that i can tell you
no he was great
no i have to do it again
no issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party as that issue by the democrats
no pressure
no sir i'd been doing it
no sir i've been doing this all my life
no we played around a golf
nobody ever heard that
nobody has done more for the african american community than the republican party
nobody would have thought we could do that but we're doing it
not 25 cents
not a drop of blood
not bad
not bad right
not in mississippi
not just concrete
not one drop
nothing's easy but it's not the same
now all i know about jim hood is he fought very hard to elect crooked hillary clinton and barack hussein obama
now i watched anderson cooper and i watched him apologize for even asking the question to biden
now i'm an honest person anyway
now i'm dealing with china right now
now they go on and they go and they go outside and they find a doctor and we take care of our great veterans
now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of mississippi
obama was easy
oh did you hear beto
oh he's central casting
oh i'd like to apologize
oh i'm going to sue him
oh it's terrible
oh no no no
oh so bravery
oh that poor bastard
oh that's wonderful
oh we don't like trump
on tuesday the proud people of mississippi will send democrats a clear message
on tuesday you're going to get out and you're going to vote and you're going to give up whatever you have to give up
one soldier stepped on a nail
open borders sanctuary cities but they have one thing
or we had to go to court and all of a sudden we start winning cases
our failed ruling class believed it was their right to rule over you to take your money to take your jobs to redistribute your wealth all over the globe wherever they wanted it
our policy of never-ending war regime change and nation-building is being replaced by the clear-eyed pursuit of american interests
past leaders foolish military adventures turned far away nations into very very dangerous war zones
people forget
phil is so confident
phil said 
please could you help me please
poor hunter
president obama left us 142
prior to running for politics he was so nice to me
proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
proving the wisdom of this approach we recently secured a permanent ceasefire in northern syria without spilling one drop of american blood
remember biden said 
remember that
remember that
remember that whole thing
remember the arms a-flailing
republican governor right
republicans believe in strong borders and safe communities
right

roger
russia
said 
see it's not so easy
see people think this is easy
senator roger wicker
she just ran
she made it about them
she ran last time
she said 
she's a beauty
she's incredible
she's not an agent of russia
she's running in 2020
she's spending all her time on this crap or this impeachment stuff
she's tough and smart and strong and she's with us all the way
she's very busy doing other things
sir $16 billion
sir i'm sorry
sir i'm the greatest salesman
sir please we're willing too much
six

so another man who's a warrior is a friend of mine
so he was a nasty guy but he had a couple of policies that don't work well in the state of texas
so hunter then goes to china
so i did all three because it's a different form of cutting
so i made this call had this wonderful call and the transcript proves it was as i said perfect
so i quote 
so if anybody wants to give up your seat please just walk out
so incredible
so many they can't even tell
so my phone call which was totally perfect and appropriate and if you want to read the transcript you see how perfect it was but they don't quit
so now you'll ask him he'll say 
so phil doesn't come to me and say 
so successful
so tate's running against a liberal democrat named jim hood
so then i said to myself 
so they have a brand new president in ukraine
so they targeted them and they brought the $16 billion down to practically nothing
so we will have pretty soon over $100 billion in money paid into the united states treasury by a country that never gave us 25 cents
so we're also joined tonight by a man who is truly and i've sort of said it a lot but he's been a great governor and he loves your state
so we're going to send a signal by sending a terrific new republican governor to jackson
so what is it all about
so when i said to the farmers 
so you come from texas you don't like religion you don't like oil and you don't have guns
so you know it's so early
some people never heard of it
sonny how much did they spend buying our corn and soy beans and all of our agricultural product
state auditor shad white
stepped on a nail
take a look at what's happening to the great city once of san francisco

thank you very much
thank you very much president obama
thanks roger
that didn't work out too well did it
that doesn't happen with republicans
that fizzled
that guy
that guy would do good
that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
that makes sense right
that means it's a loophole
that means you can come in illegally and lots of things
that story disappeared so fast
that story was a massive story
that was a total hoax the single greatest lies ever foisted upon the american people
that was a tough one
that was quite a day
that was the biggest maybe the biggest one of the biggest ever
that was the last we've seen of hunter
that wasn't good
that's a big lot of land
that's a horrible name right
that's enough
that's fine
that's incredible
that's not a good combination in the state of texas
that's not bad
that's not bad when you're on the debate stage and you say 
that's not good in mississippi either
that's not happening anymore
that's the one i want
that's true
that's true with many countries
that's what happened in 2016
that's what it was
that's what they're going to say
that's what we're doing
that's why you have to go with tate reeves
the aids epidemic
the american people are fed up with democrat lies hoaxes and extremism
the big companies they couldn't get their money back both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint
the bush dynasty was
the caliphate it was the size physically of ohio the state of ohio the great state of ohio
the campaign to impeach president trump has just begun
the democrat healthcare agenda would obliterate medicare
the democrat party has never been more extreme you know that than it is today
the democrats don't seem to have any mitt romneys
the democrats the media and the deep state are desperate to stop us
the democrats they didn't want that wall
the democrats' outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote many do-nothing democrats out of office in 2020
the do-nothing democrats need to stop their madness and pass the usmca right now
the fake news they apologize
the good news is biden didn't know too much about what the hell he was talking about
the great rebuilding of the american armed forces has included massive investments in the military and facilities in biloxi and gulfport and jackson and starkville
the great sellout has ended and it ended the day i took the oath of office
the great state of mississippi and by the way the birthplace of a gentleman not too many people heard of him elvis presley
the last administration's horrendous trans-pacific partnership would have destroyed the us auto industry but i proudly first thing withdrew from that job-killing calamity
the lying the falsifying over the past three years plus before i ever even announced they were spying
the morning of his father's very bad debate but it's where is hunter
the most unified i've ever seen them
the next step to victory begins on tuesday right here in your great state
the people get it
the people of mississippi can't take it anymore
the radical left is determined to transform america into a country you would not recognize
the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream
the republicans have great policy
the usmca will be a massive victory for mississippi's farmers and also includes powerful protections for mississippi auto workers manufacturers and everybody else
their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs and they want to make a deal because those tariffs have given us millions of dollars and billions now billions and billions of dollars
then he got brought out by obama out of the trash heap became vice president
then the mueller witch hunt it never ended
then they demanded that american citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted nations and regions
then when he came onto the really big stage this crazy stage i noticed he was flailing with the arms and he was standing on tables
then you've got to release them
there's no place better to have a rally to have a good time and to also at the same time be very serious than at a trump rally especially on friday night in mississippi
these are very dishonest people and the media is worse than all of them
these gangs are the worst people
these people are sick
these people are sick
these people are sick
these people these are not human beings
they actually spied on my campaign
they always like to mention exactly what happened
they are coming after the republican party and me because i'm fighting for you
they are not liking me
they brought back almost $1 trillion now because of us
they came in and all he had was donald trump and we won
they can go out get a doctor we pay the bill and they don't have to wait six weeks four weeks two weeks
they could never believe it
they did just the opposite
they don't know what they're doing
they don't like it
they don't like me too much
they don't want to do it
they had president obama they had michelle obama they had oprah winfrey
they had the worst year that they've had in 57 years
they have lousy policies
they know it
they knowingly decimated american manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries
they love her
they love our country
they must think we're nuts to be honest
they never have
they never respected us
they only took
they only took
they right now have 27000 soldiers on our borders
they said 
they said 
they said 
they stick together and they're vicious
they want open borders which mean crime
they want sanctuary cities which means crime and drugs and death
they want to give them free healthcare
they want to give them this
they want to give these people that come into our country illegally all benefits and he opposed our travel ban which is so important that we won in the united states supreme court to keep terrorists the hell out of our country
they were love fests
they were so thrilled
they weren't very sick
they'd be talking about his bravery
they're colluders
they're corrupt
they're great
they're just very vicious people
they're loopholes
they're moving thousands of people from ms-13
they're not as vicious but they have a tendency to split apart
they're obstructionists
they're terrible
they're the ones
they've been fighting for 1000 years
they've been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment i won
they've never been this high
they've never had anything like this
they've never quite figured it out
this guy built isis
this is different
this is great to be with you tonight the great state of mississippi
this is one i never thought i'd be involved in
this is the exact everything they wanted
this isn't easy
this young beautiful person in front of me
to get relief to working families we passed massive tax cuts on average $2000 to $2500 per family bringing almost $1 trillion back home to our shores
to lift up distressed communities we created opportunities zones
to protect america's security i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal
to protect our communities my administration restricted migration from terror-prone nations and implemented the toughest ever vetting procedures
together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration
totally phony deal
toughest ever that we've ever had
trent kelly michael guest
true
true
tuesday
tuesday go out and vote for tate
two of the worst deals ever made by our country
under my administration we've already added nearly 10000 new factories and many more are coming in as we speak
under republican leadership jobs are booming confidence is soaring wages are rising crime is falling and our nation is stronger than ever before
under the previous two administrations we lost 60000 factories in our country
unemployment in mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded ever recorded
unfortunately in about 10 seconds a picture came out where they're playing golf together but he never met him
very important
very slow
virtually every democrat also now supports late-term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
warriors you're warriors

we are finally putting america first
we are going to keep on fighting
we are now building a wall
we are now the number one producer of energy by far anywhere in the world
we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god
we are returning power to you the american people
we are the ones standing in their way and we will never get out of their way
we believe in keeping terrorists and criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country
we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great american flag
we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true american way
we can't forget that
we could have done this one on monday night
we did not fight them over there only to invite them over here
we do

we don't have them in the white house
we don't show them anymore
we don't want to do that

we stand on the shoulders of american patriots who crossed the oceans settled the continent tamed the wilderness dug out the panama canal laid down the railroads revolutionized industry pioneered technology won two world wars defeated fascism and communism and made america the single greatest nation in the history of the world
we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement

we'll also help out ourselves if that's okay
we'll always take care of them
we'll get so tired of winning
we'll have it ended in america in 10 years
we'll see
we'll see what happens
we're also fighting deadly sanctuary cities with the help of states like mississippi which has banned sanctuary cities because phil bryant said 
we're building it
we're building it
we're dealing with life right
we're draining the swamp in washington
we're going to end the aids epidemic within 10 years
we're going to send you $16 billion and it's already been sent
we're not going to have them
we're not going to have them
we're not going to have them

well let's see
well poor pathetic guy
well sir we'd like steel but would also like concrete and would also like rebar
well son of a bitch he got fired
well that didn't work out so well
well the governor of virginia executed a baby
well the hatred i mean between him and fredo
well they've never had an election like 2016 either have they
well we were actually just checking things out
well what do you want
what a great job
what a job
what a stupid question
what a thought
what have they done to this beautiful show
what is he on
what the hell is he doing
what was it
what's happening
when beto quit he quit like a dog
when he quit i said 
when i came into office it was very very depleted but it ain't depleted anymore
when they told me that i said 
when you're at 1% there's always a reason
whenever there's a problem he's there
where did that come from
where is al-baghdadi
where is he
where's hunter
where's hunter
where's hunter
where's hunter
where's phil
which one
who would do it
who would've thought
whoever the hell wants to listen they listen and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people
why is it always the united states
winning a lot of cases
with 18 angry democrats and an unlimited budget let's go get him
with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working
with your support we will show the corrupt democrats that the american people are not ever going to back down from perhaps the greatest victory in political history
within 10 years it will be over
yep
yesterday the democrats voted to potentially nullify the votes of 63 million americans disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the house of representatives
yesterday's vote by the radical democrats is an attack on democracy itself
you are warriors
you ask president putin 
you can cut through steel but you can't through the concrete and then you can't through the hardened rebar
you can take it a little bit low key
you can't
you catch them
you couldn't get the money
you ever see these people
you give this son who has zero experience with investing too you give him $1
you got to get out
you had the best year you've ever had
you have the best mississippi the best year you've ever had in the history of our country
you have to continue that whole thing going forward
you have to pay
you just won
you know he ran against ted cruz
you know i said that once before and this crazy nancy pelosi said 
you know in a certain way i was impressed because i mean i didn't think he had the energy the brain power
you know right now we have the cleanest air and the cleanest water that we've ever had and yet we're number one in the world in energy by far
you know the truth is anybody that says they're a great salesman usually they're not a very good salesman
you know we got to impeach him because we can't beat him
you know what
you know what that is
you know when he made that phony speech where he made up a really horrible speech and said that i said it i said 
you know when she made that statement about me three years ago it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement
you never have a good story
you never saw anything like it
you see what's going on
you think hillary would do that
you think obama would do that
you think sleepy joe would do that
you understand
you'll never see it disappear
you'll see a lot more people trying to get in
you're going to leave work maybe a little early or maybe get there a little late
you're not getting the money
you're supposed to leave none when you leave office but that didn't work out too well
you're the man
you're very wealthy
you're winning
your next attorney general lynn fitch
your next secretary of state michael watson
your next state treasure david mcrae
your second amendment is under attack but not with him
your statistic
$ 160 million two great places
$250 billion coming in
175
175000 people signed up
401k
5 million people have joined the workforce
50% and we can give the benefit for the people that live in florida or colorado or new jersey or wherever you are
65 years for women
a lot of bad people
a lot of bad people in the swamp
a lot of countries aren't doing so well just so you understand
a lot of people were saying a year ago 
a massive win for new jersey workers new jersey farmers new jersey union people new jersey manufacturers and everybody
a record number of americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working another record
african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country
after years of devastating defense cuts we have fully rebuilt the united states military
all of a sudden the doctor wasn't so good right
all of my people i say 
also in wildwood like we're in the middle of winter
america is thriving like never before
americans of all political beliefs are sick and tired of the radical rage filled left socialists
and after i got it done and i mean solely got it done and after i got it done they had news conferences
and by the way when we talk about inheriting victory in 2020 in our nation just so you understand under a big tax cut biggest tax cut plan in history guess what you have
and gave the world american greats like thomas edison and frank sinatra old blue eyes
and i gave him authorization 
and i got it approved about 11 months ago
and i got it done but that's the way it is
and i never even knew the swamp was this bad
and i said 
and if you would have had the other party winning this last election instead of your market being up 72%
and it could have been started sooner by the past administration they chose not to do it
and ladies and gentlemen of new jersey place i love the best is yet to come
and my friends so many people in this group i know them well
and now we have to do it again to keep it going
and right here in wildwood new jersey
and that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
and that's what's happening
and the va is doing fantastically well
and then they send you a bill for $25000
and these people that i fight every day they came to me 
and two great supreme court justices two great ones
and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
and we are making it greater and greater every day
and we are modernizing critical vaccines
and we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great american flag
and we recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
and we will always live by the words of our national motto in god we trust
and we will make america great again
and you can't fix it unless you have democrat votes that's why you got to vote the house
and you know we all have a heart
another couple of good months it'll be historic
anybody want to be with ice
are we doing good for the veterans
as soon as i got it done they don't even want to mention my name
as we rebuild our military we have authorized over $160 million to support our warriors at a place called huh mcguire air force base and fort dix
at stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation
bad people in the swamp you thought this was going to be easy right
beautiful
because they didn't want to hurt anybody except the problem is the people were going to die soon
because together we will make america wealthy again
because who would even think this
best planes best missiles best everything made in america
billions and billions and billions of dollars and not government dollars they're flowing into the opportunities zones into areas where investment was dead
build it
but above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america
but because of price transparency we are getting it done
but for 45 years but for 45 years they've been trying to get it veteran's choice
but i got it approved
but i only used to talk about them when i was doing well otherwise i wouldn't
but mexico is in fact you will soon find out paying for the wall
but now she thinks i'm a great investor
but on june 2nd everybody has to do us all a favor
but on no issue have washington democrats thoroughly betrayed the american people than the issue of immigration
but that's an all-time record
but they're fake
but think of this
but two brave guys two great politicians
but we could have filled up the meadowlands arena two or three times
but we're going to be signing up millions and millions of registered independents democrat voters
but we're making health care better and much much cheaper
but what happened is through a series of court cases and other things the money has won and we are now building that beautiful wall and this powerful border wall is going up at record speed and we just reached over 100 miles of wall and by next year we'll be over 400 miles and shortly thereafter it will be complete
but you see i said i was smart and they looked back at me and they said 
by the way ice has removed thousands upon thousands of ms-13 gang members the most brutal people
by the way our second amendment is under siege
by the way some time prior to the end of the year we're putting in for a new middle income tax cut a very big one
chris
close your factories
criminal justice reform
darling you're the most brilliant person in history
democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
democrats don't want that
democrats stand for crime corruption and chaos
democrats want and you know this democrats want to raid medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants
do it
do it
does anybody here not love their child or their children
don't tell me that
during national school choice week we reaffirmed that no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school
during the 16 years of the two prior administrations under just three years my administration has now added 12000 new factories and many more are being built and they're pouring back into the united states because that's where the action is
earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% first time ever
energy including through the so-called green new deal
ever recorded
everyone said 
everyone's swinging or they end up standing up
everything
everything's transparent
fake
fake news
finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic can you believe this in america in 10 years or less
folks i have the greatest idea
for 45 years they've been trying to get it passed
for 48 years they've been trying to get veterans choice
for decades politicians ran for office promising to protect american workers but then they went to washington and they lined their pockets with special address cash and they shipped american jobs and dreams to other countries
for decades we had politicians that didn't care about that phrase
for example cumberland county we all know cumberland county very well right
for games you're playing ice hockey or basketball so we broke the all-time record in this house
for president bush in eight years it was $450 over eight years
for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
for years you've been losing your ass with 401ks
frank sinatra
frankly they're crazy
from camden to clifton all the way down the shore to ocean city and sea isle and stone harbor
from morristown to vineland and patterson to pennington
get out and vote
get rid of these clowns
get rid of your cows
get the hell out of here
globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob our factories steal our farms and ransack our communities
go
good luck with this one
governor ron desantis came to me
great chris great job
have you ever heard of those places
have you ever heard of those places new jersey
he came to my office and he had this idea that he's wanted to do for a long time
he didn't build the wall
he didn't build the wall yet
he is a tireless champion for the state of new jersey
he is now at large free to search for another innocent victim
he just said 
he loves our military loves our vets and police
he loves your second amendment which is under siege by the democrats
he really is
he said 
he supports lower taxes not bad
he was a piece of work that i can tell you
he's a great guy he's a brave guy he shares our values
he's exaggerating
he's going to have a big victory
he's going to have a big victory
he's had enough
he's lying pinocchio pinocchio
he's not around anymore
help help help
here's what we're going to do
how did that work jeff
how did you get elected with that one
i am like the smart i have an idea because the veterans are waiting online
i am so smart
i call them trailers
i chose to do it
i could get anything
i could read these cases honestly i could read and state these cases to you all night
i could state these cases to you all night
i do
i got it done
i got it done
i got it done
i got it done
i got people to vote for it that they could have never gotten
i had one gentlemen come up 
i have people coming up to me all the time
i have the greatest idea
i have the greatest idea
i have to say this america is winning again and america is thriving again like never before
i have to tell you a few weeks ago jeff was one of the few brave and principled democrat lawmakers in all fairness we've been after him for a longtime who stood up to the house democrats and the outrageous abusive power that you see going on right now
i have to tell you more people almost 160 million are working right now in the united states
i just want to thank republicans because what they've been doing is incredible
i love new jersey and i'm thrilled to be back right here in the garden state
i never told you about all of these things that we got
i never told you about space force
i never understood
i passed two of them coming in brand new beautiful plants and factories
i really mean that it's the survival of our nation
i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i see the leaders they say 
i tell you he really is he's a brave guy
i think he's on his way
i think he's on his way
i think new jersey is different
i thought i had the greatest secret
i want to thank mexico because you know what's happening right
i want to thank the president
i'm also very proud to report that we won a critical supreme court victory yesterday on immigration
i'm not doing it
i'm not doing it
i'm so smart
i've achieved more than i promised
if anybody would like to give them your place please let us know but we have thousands and thousands
if i wanted to build anything the only thing they put the whole weight of their party they didn't want us to have the wall
if i wanted to spend money on anything look with the military we got two trillion dollars right
if i would have said that during the campaign that we were going to produce numbers like this the fakeness would have been hitting me
if they don't have money they go home and they die
if they have 10000 like pocahontas went into central park in new york
if they have money they go to asia they go to europe they go all over the world looking for help
if they think they're going to get free education free healthcare they're all going to come
if you can say 50% or 25% or 15% buy it
if you don't love your children don't leave it to them and then you do have a problem
if you don't say it they're not going to come
if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for it to secure then we must devote everything that we have toward victory in 2020
in all due respect to mexico we like mexico very much and we've gotten along great with mexico and the president's a friend of mine and i think he's doing a fantastic job
in just three years of my administration 3
in our glorious battle to win american independence george washington
in the eight years before i took office over 300000 working age people left the workforce
in virginia they want to take your guns away
instead of your 401ks being up numbers that you can't even believe where your wife or your husband says 
instead they order them to be released into your community
is that a fact
is that okay
it didn't take much because he believes like we do
it will never be better than what's coming
it's a disaster
it's a hoax it's a scam i'm not doing it
it's a tough situation
it's a wonderful house in a wonderful community
it's about time
it's about time
it's all they know how to do
it's been a little bit of a story
it's been many many decades
it's been so long
it's big ideas and we have a big future together
it's called jersey
it's called right to try and they get the newest and the best and the latest medicine where it's looking good but you're not going to have it for five more years and you know why they didn't do it
it's finally working and they want to destroy it
it's going to be an incredible thing
it's going up very substantial
it's incredible what happened to your country
it's just the beginning
it's like a giant tree you plant it but it takes time to grab on
it's not happening
it's not happening folks
it's one of the greatest moments
it's probably the greatest movement in history
it's so nice
it's still anything that comes over is too much but we're blocking it at a record number
it's very nice
jeff gave me a number he said 
jeff had the guts to defy the left-wing fanatics in his own party and to stand tall in defense of our constitution our freedom and democracy itself
jeff it's an honor to be with you
jeff just told you he had 175000 people sign up
jeff van drew what he did was incredible
joe pennacchio
left-wing lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of health care that would strip 180 million americans of their private health care plans which many people like
left-wing radical politician support deadly sanctuary cities and remember a sanctuary city is a jurisdiction that refuses to hand over criminal aliens that are in local law enforcement custody
less regulation a strong national defense
let me just tell you so here's the story so we have these massive crowds that fill up stadiums every single time
let me tell you
let them have it
let's go
local authorities released him and he went on to commit a gruesome triple murder
look at what's happening to their cities
los angeles it's so sad
made in the usa
many of them voted five years ago for a wall
maybe
maybe we'll do it during the summer
maybe you do a couple of tough people up there
median household income is at an all time high
more
more people are working today in the state of new jersey than ever before
more than two million millennials have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5% every year which is a record
my friends
my wife never respected me for anything not anything
nah that's a big thing
never going to happen as long as i'm president of the united states
new business applications in new jersey have just soared to a record high and we have lifted 10 million people nationwide off federal welfare
new jersey
new jersey is different
new jersey is the state where george washington led a die hard band of american patriots to victory at trenton and princeton and monmouth
no but these ice people they love our country
no he's only having fun
no i want to be in south jersey
no i'm only kidding
no legs no arms
no more estate tax no more death tax for your small farms and business
no president has wanted to do it
nobody believes i was able to do it but we did it
nobody believes it including the fake news
nobody else was going to do it
nobody would've believed these numbers
nobody's ever cut regulations
not anymore not anymore because we are defenseless no more because long last you have a president who puts america first
now the wall is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by mexico and it's an advantage for mexico too when you think about it
now we actually have the money and it's going up very rapidly
now you can fire
now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of new jersey
now you look at him you say 
now you're making a fortune
now you're making a fortune
number one you have to get out and vote republican
oh i'm feeling better
oh that's going to be so nice
oh the crowds are so large
okay
once set loose these criminal aliens are free to continue their crimes spree against innocent americans
only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all
our child tax credit alone is delivering $2200 a year to 40 million american families
our veterans are doing great
people sign something and they don't hold the country responsible
people that love our state
pipelines are good
please please
president bush couldn't get it
president obama tried he couldn't get it done
proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
remember i used to go over polls
republican leadership in this country we're winning winning winning like never before
republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race religion color and creed
republicans stand for law order and justice and say what you want but those are the facts
right
right
right
right
right here another criminal alien was arrested for a violent assault in new jersey
right here in new jersey your state's democrat leaders have instituted sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your community
ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
s
san francisco starting in new york
school choice very important
senator tim scott he's an incredible guy
senator tim scott opportunity zones and jobs and investment are now pouring into nearly 170 newly designated opportunity zones right here in new jersey all over the united states
seriously you have to see outside
she had 10000 people like in central park
should we do it during the summer
should you move this to the meadowlands
since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased listen to this by 47% three times faster than the increase for the top 1%
since the election we have created seven million new jobs
sir
sir this system is so bad
sir we can buy the drugs in canada for 50% less
sir we've known about that concept for 45 years
so i come back one day i say to my people 
so if you love your children they won't have to mortgage the plant
so smart
so we have the greatest doctors the greatest technicians the greatest labs in the world and we'll have a drug that's looking good but it's going to take five more years and by the way we've brought the timing way down from 12 years to half of that but it takes years to get it approved
soleimani loved that
soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of americans and actively planning new attacks but we stopped him cold
some are okay and they end up being terminally ill by the time they see the doctors too long
some of the results are incredible
someday they're going to write the true story
soon it's going to be historic
sorry about that
state senators mike testa and joe pennacchio
swamp is bad bad people

thanks to our tireless efforts of border patrol to secure our border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row
thanks to the incredible courage of our warriors the greatest warriors in the world the isis caliphate has been totally destroyed and its savage founder and leader al-baghdadi is dead
that i can tell you
that means they come in frankly they're just as good as the big names but they sell for 80% less in some cases
that phrase didn't mean anything to them
that result in more product proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase 
that was a big thing
that was a big thing
that was his weapon of choice
that's a big deal and that will take effect starting in about two months from now
that's a big difference
that's a good fact the lowest in history
that's okay
that's the end of that
that's the end of that and you know what they do
that's the highest level of employment in the history of our country
that's what it is
that's what's happening now
that's where they want to be
that's why all these jobs are being built
that's why i always say you have to thank yourself because nobody else is going to do it
the 2016 election was probably i mean you could say the greatest election in the history of our country
the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration listen to this one in united states history
the best we've ever had
the democrats are increasing drug prices
the do nothing democrats
the doctor was fantastic
the garden state
the good news is it's much easier because here i've done it all
the legs the arms wiped out
the new jersey unemployment rate has reached the lowest of all time
the only one they didn't think was president trump
the plans of every democrat running for president would demolish the economy of new jersey where half a million new new jersey workers are employed at some of the best and most innovative health care employment companies
the press is very dishonest
the republican party is doing great
the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and the american dream
the republican party respected again
the republican party will never let it happen
the same drug made in the same factory made by the same company
the sanctuary jurisdiction of middlesex county defied the ice request to detain him
the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world
the united states laws listen to this number and you know if it was wrong the fake news would be all over me and i've been saying it for three years
the united states lost 60000 factories and plants
the veterans
the wall is a vital barrier for blocking deadly drugs from pouring into these communities
the wall so many people were saying 
there is nobody in the middle of winter and it's a great place in the summer
there'll never be anything like what we're doing
these are all things that we had to fight like hell to get
these are the communities that really have suffered
these people are crazy
they are off federal welfare
they are pouring back into our country new plants and factories
they bring the ms-13 and many other gang members and other members back to el salvador back to honduras back to guatemala back to mexico
they call it a pack and they start swinging
they came to me they couldn't get it done including many conservatives
they can't win an election so they're trying to steal an election
they closed up your factories
they could be so many other things
they could steal they could rob
they couldn't get it done
they couldn't get it done
they didn't have to pay taxes
they didn't want to give him to ice and i want to thank ice because the abuse they take and the incredible job they do
they don't hold the drug company responsible
they don't know what the hell they're doing
they got rid of your jobs
they had no choice
they have spent the last three years and probably even before i came down on that beautiful escalator with our beautiful future first lady trying to overthrow the last election
they just didn't know how to get it built
they knew it worked
they know because they have to follow they're trailers
they made it 
they never mention it
they never mention it so maybe they will tonight
they oppose it
they oppose it
they released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child
they said 
they say 
they want to be where the action is
they want to raise your taxes
they were killing our country killing our country
they won't have to be mortgage the farm as the expression goes
they won't have to mortgage anything there's no tax
they'd hit you with that
they're all coming back
they're all going to come
they're fake
they're not honest
they're off
they're pouring back in
they're proud and they're tough people and they'll go right into a pack
they're smart they're great people
they're taking their cues from socialists like bernie
they're terminally ill
they're thanking people that i never even heard of
they're tough
they're underground they're good environmentally sound
they're waiting online for two weeks three weeks four weeks ten weeks
they've been tried to do it for 45 or so years
they've been trying to do that one for 52 years
they've let go of more than 8000 bad people
think of that
think of that ending the aids epidemic within 10 years that we've started
think of this for a second
this country has tremendous potential if we don't blow it
this has always been the home of the proud loyal and very very incredible americans
this has been going on for a long time
this is a lot of fun
this is not a brand new place and unfortunately it holds 10000 people or less
this is the state that pioneered the boardwalk the diner and the motion picture
this is the state where generations of tough and strong new jersey craftsmen and dock hands farmers and factory workers built this country into the single greatest nation on the face of the earth
this is where the action is
this is where they want to be
this november we are going to win back the house we are going to hold the senate and we are going to keep the white house
this young men could have 10000 people you know that in central park
those are things that people don't even realize
those streets are packed all the way back to the airplane practically
thousands and thousands at this moment 27000 soldiers from mexico protecting our southern border
tim scott right
to give former prisoners a second chance at life we pass bi-partisan criminal justice reform
to lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most
to uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 brand new beautiful federal judges who will interpret the constitution as written
today i had the best polls that i've ever had since being elected
together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration
together we're achieving historic victories for new jersey families
tomorrow we will replace the nafta nightmare one of the worst trade deals ever in history with the incredible brand new us-mexico-canada agreement the usmca
took us a long time to get there and we really picked it up over the last three years
two incredible new jersey natives you've never heard of kellyanne conway have you say something
two trillion all made in america right
under president barack hussein obama for eight years it was $975 so eight years eight years 450 975 under your favorite president and when you include the tax cuts the regulation cuts that nobody's ever cut taxes like this
under president trump for three years the number is almost $10000 and that's three years and it's going up
under the trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of anybody
va choice
virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion
voters are making a mass exodus from that party and we are welcoming them to the republican party with wide open arms
washington democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now

we called him 
we created with the help of a great gentleman from the state of south carolina you know who i'm talking about

we didn't like him
we don't need anybody else's energy anymore

we're grateful to have with us this evening some wonderful friends of mine people that i've known forever your former governor who did a terrific job chris christie
we're making less paperwork for your doctors and giving you easy control of your medical records which is a big deal for a lot of people
we're making so much progress
we're restoring america's industrial might like never before
we're winning again and we've got a party that's a very different part a much stronger party a much more inclusive party
we've already started the process
we've done a great job in running it and we've given you a lot of alternatives
we've just passed a thing called right to try
we've transformed veteran's health care including through va choice right
weeks ago at my direction the us military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist qasem soleimani
weeks ago we also signed a fantastic new trade agreement with china that will boost new jersey exports and defend new jersey jobs
well it's not easy when you have the weight of an entire party and they control the house not easy
well we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the congressional democrats are obsessed with demented hoaxes crazy witch hunts and deranged partisan crusades
what happened in the last three years with energy is incredible but extreme liberals in washington want to shut down u
what he did was incredible
what is going on
what the hell is going on
what we did is a thing called right to try
what we're doing is stopping drugs at a record number
what we've done is incredible pipelines all over
what you see is so sad with the homeless and the way they don't take care of the homeless
what's the big deal
when you have the strength of a party that has the house okay hopefully they're not going to have the house for long
where people could mistreat our veterans do whatever they want they could be sadistic
which is worse the impeachment hoax or the witch hunts from russia
with your help and your devotion with your drive we are going to keep on working
women's unemployment is at a 65 year low
yeah it's some fun
yet washington democrats like crazy bernie sanders and nervous nancy pelosi they opposed our action to save american lives
you could take a look at what's happening to our cities run by democrats
you couldn't do a thing
you couldn't do anything you'd keep them
you don't have too many cows in wildwood but if you do they're gone
you don't hear that because this is a blue collar boom
you don't want to do that job
you go home you say 
you got a lot of tough people in new jersey
you got to get us back the house
you have a business you have a farm you have a small business no more inheritance tax no more what we call death tax
you have criminals that are on the streets that should be in jail
you have criminals that on the street that should be taken the hell out of our country and brought back to where they came from
you have people that are terminally ill
you have to get out and vote for really a brave man
you have to see the results and i've seen some of the results
you know how long it took me to make that decision
you know i haven't been doing this that long so four years ago i'm campaigning for president
you know if another candidate has 1000 people they say he spoke to a massive crowd
you know the roadside bombs that you see hurting our people and lots of other people so badly
you know what that is
you know why
you see it
you see it every single day
you see the fakers back there
you see them all over
you wouldn't think that's possible because of stupid trade deals because of bad leadership
you'll be able to go and price other hospitals other doctors
you'll be able to see pricing
you're fired you're fired
you're our kind of guy
you've made me look so smart
your wonderful republican state chairman doug steinhardt what a job he's doing
10
10 years is too much
27000 and i did that so that we don't put tariffs on their products coming in it was very simple
28 billion over two years they got hit one year 16 billion one year 12 billion
28 okay that's fine
3 million jobs for north carolina workers
31]
4
4 million
4%
5 to a half
5 trillion in the united states military all made in the usa by the way we have the newest finest military we've ever had and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many many decades
50 50 and 0
56 days from now we're going to win north carolina
6 million jobs in the last four months
8 billion in cash
a lot of people think he won and it got taken away
a new branch of the united states military the united states armed forces called air force
a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs and a limitless future for all americans
a woman sitting there she wants to eat
african american vote much better hispanic vote much better
after 47 years he's had a change of heart
after 47 years i've changed
after we get in we're going to have tremendous success
after years of rebuilding other countries we are finally building our country
al-baghdadi and soleimani the two worst terrorists in the world for many many years many decades
all over the country but did you notice he's starting to talk a little bit tougher now did you notice that
all over the country it's amazing
all right let's go
all they have to do is call us
america first
america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
and actually if we weren't interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere
and before the china virus we achieved the lowest african american hispanic american asian american unemployment rates ever recorded
and biden
and biden was against it
and by the way you know who's further left than crazy bernie
and by the way your state should be open
and even if you look statistically it's you it's michigan it's a couple of others
and frankly i thought the last one was and i said it but they've gone to a level that nobody even thought possible
and frankly if the shoe was on the other foot if it was on the other foot you'd have many people 20 25 people right now in jail for two years and they'd be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it's treason or whatever else you want to call it
and he has stated that if he is elected charter schools are gone
and he just really left
and hopefully we never have to use them i will say that
and i don't know who i'd rather run against
and i must say this is a choice for many many decades
and i put out when is he going to be arrested
and i said it was going to happen
and i say this because it's from charlotte to kitty hawk from durham to asheville and from wilmington to right here in winston-salem
and i thought that was bad
and i will reopen nasa
and i'll tell you what on november 4th every one of those states will be open
and i'll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go
and i'm sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car oftentimes it's below $2
and i'm thrilled to be in winston salem with thousands of loyal hard working american patriots
and i've spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country
and in portland you see what happened last night they arrested over 50 people the first time
and it was building
and it's a disgrace that it's taken this long
and it's a great deal
and it's a shame what's going on
and it's not only is it a v it's a super v
and just in finishing i have to say that over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world
and let me just tell you a little secret
and maybe as i said much sooner than that
and never forget they're coming after me because i'm fighting for you
and nobody has been through what i've been through as president of the united states nobody
and now we are very simply we're doing it again and we're on track to have as i said the best year we've ever had next year
and now we have to work against a guy that doesn't know where he is i can't believe it
and now what's going to happen is we'll have it and people won't want to take it
and remember that great
and remember this if biden wins the violent mobs you see these mobs all over the place
and she wears that dress right through the middle of hollywood and everyone says thank you very much
and that was in order to get me and by the way china wants joe biden so badly
and that's what you're in right now
and then i realized if you look at that last few months we were starting to come together
and then i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in the middle east peace for many many decades decades
and then they said well we'll do it easily
and then they went up a little bit and now i said 
and they all said no no it's got to be a 100
and they come and they grab her food
and they do come after me
and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more
and they said donald trump is projected the winner of 2016
and they thought i think they didn't think it but i'll tell you what anything we had then we have much more now
and they went in about 15 minutes later
and they'll say what a great president he is
and they've been incredible
and this is something that's incredible
and this is that super v
and together with the incredible people of north carolina we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america proud again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again
and we are making it greater than ever before
and we don't have crime and we don't have this violence
and we want to send them in so badly
and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions always
and we will end our reliance on china once and for all
and we will have a great third quarter
and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in god we trust
and we'll also take good care of our teachers
and we're heading back to that level rapidly
and whether it was the black community the hispanic community the asian community our jobs were so good our numbers were so good
and you know he talks about like well he's going to do this
and you know we call you peaceful protesters you know why
and you know what
and you know what's going to happen
and you saw the mueller family on television
and you say what's happening
and you'rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world
and your drug prices prescription drug i'm instituting favorite nations laws
any governor that does that
are you seeing
are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out
beautiful
because as crazy as it sounds he was hot
because i ended that iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1
because if we win america wins
because the fact is we don't have to be in the middle east other than we want to protect israel
because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things
because they have rules in these democrat run states that if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people
because this is important we win north carolina we win
because this is not like a second place crowd
because we've really implemented things
biden also cheered the rise of china as a positive development positive development for america and for the world
biden got the nomination
biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left you know that with crazy bernie and everyone
biden has pledged to end production of american oil shale clean coal no fracking wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters
biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that america is racist
biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations
biden opposes school choice he opposes north carolina opportunity scholarships
biden said the other day well if the experts told me
biden spent the last 47 years betraying african american voters
biden supported nafta china's entry into the world trade organization tpp the south korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens
biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail
biden voted for the iraq war he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden he opposed the killing of soleimani he oversaw the rise of isis and for eight years he couldn't find or kill al-baghdadi the founder of isis
biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax hike a ban on american energy eliminate america's borders confiscate your guns
biden's a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to american communities
biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists
biggest order of corn biggest order of beef biggest order of soybeans and i gave the farmers $28 billion because that's what you were targeted for by china and i gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the u
build a wall build a wall true
but all of these places are democrat run places radical left run places
but do you remember last time too
but he was better against bernie
but i said 
but i said that was going to happen
but i would say walls and wheels have a great future
but if biden would have sat back and if elizabeth warren pocahontas you remember pocahontas
but if she would have dropped out on super tuesday prior to super tuesday bernie would have been the nominee
but if sleepy joe biden takes power the economy will collapse
but if this guy doesn't open up your state because almost all of them are open now if he doesn't open up your state you have no choice you're going to vote for him anyway but dan you'll be so good
but if you come back in a thousand years there are two things with all the computers and all the everything changes every day you invent a new cell you invent a new laptop
but in the other debates he was giving them everything they want
but lincoln was very very badly treated by the fake news
but next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody's taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven't seen
but nobody's been and should never be allowed to happen again
but oftentimes i say bring people together
but one of the things they did first of all we did much better
but other than that we don't have to be in the middle east
but she said 
but the best way of not having to use them is to have them
but the biden-harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we're close to putting it out getting it out and we're going to get it out fast
but the big deal is he's changed
but the big difference is she's smarter than he is
but the dc committee did you see about that
but the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they're united by their contempt for the american middle class in the truest sense
but the other is a basic disaster for our country
but they make up stories horrible stories many many
but they picked somebody from california
but they say it's very much different
but they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the united states economy again
but they're like this
but we did it once we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event a terrible event a horrible event
but what obama did and biden did with that horrible iran deal
but you go to jail for 10 years
but you just take a look at what's going on in north carolina
but you know what
but young people are very strong against this horrible disease
by contrast my administration is following the science protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school go back to school go back to school
by the way i've gotten the support of almost every police group in the country
c
can you imagine that
chicago over the weekend many people killed many people shot shot
come here
could you add the word safety
could you imagine if this guy's in and prices start dropping like a rock
could you imagine if this guy's president and your prices start to go way down hospitalization doctors you can choose your own doctor unlike with obama right
couldn't find him they looked they couldn't find him
dan forest go and vote
did you see him in the debates
do what you want vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else
do you believe that
do you remember that
do you remember that like immediately
doing a great job
don't worry about it
drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody's ever seen favored nations
earlier this year i kept my promise to north carolina when we ended the nafta nightmare and we signed the brand new us-mexico-canada agreement into law it's been incredible
even hillary beat him
even the new york times said that was an amazing achievement
every day it's something
everybody told me 
everyone said 
everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it right
finally he left his basement
flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants including many from jihadist regions of the world
for 20 years for 20 years you look at a chart it's just been this way for 20 years
for half a century joe biden shook hands with blue collar workers and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back
for instance you never heard me say you never heard me say a lot of you were at various rallies you never heard me talking about space force
fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word
four years ago
frankly i'm not sure
free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally colleges everything
get out and vote for him
get out and vote for him okay
give me that
give me that food
go in a little early and say 
good luck
got to be careful with those ballots watch those ballots
great people
he betrayed them
he betrayed them what he did to them
he closed the factories in baltimore and sent them to beijing
he couldn't get elected dogcatcher in utah right now
he did better with african americans than we thought
he did better with asians than we thought
he did better with hispanic than we thought
he did really well with women
he doesn't
he doesn't he will never stop
he gave her a hell of a fight
he got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again
he got the nomination
he had other charges against him
he has no clue
he has passed criminal justice reform prison reform delivered permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities that obama never did or couldn't do
he killed a young man in the middle of the street violently
he left three and a half four years ago
he loves your state he'll be a great governor
he never was not in prime time and certainly not now
he really has
he said 
he said the other day well if i win that doesn't mean that's going to stop
he said they're gone
he said we got problems
he sees what's going on his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what's going on
he shattered the plants in chicago and sent them to shanghai
he wants to get rid of your second amendment
he wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records
he wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country
he was better against bernie
he was not too good but that's okay
he won't even know the difference
he would have never done it
he'll never get to say that can't say that because then it'd lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party
he's a beauty i'll tell you that guy
he's a nicer person but he's not smart
he's been there for 47 years
he's changed
he's doing a great job robert o'brien
he's going to do this
he's half competent and heading south rapidly
he's misrepresenting
he's not too popular
he's not too popular i want to tell you he's not a very popular guy in utah
he's wrong it was 14500 he's misrepresenting
here in north carolina voting is already underway
hey look look at last time the fake dirty dossier
hey someday i'm going to have a limp
his son goes sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with
how are we doing with china
how are you going to deal with putin kim jong-un and president xi of china
how the hell did this ever happen
how's the economy
i agree with him on that
i always say and i've said it four or five times
i banned it
i call it obiden
i can tell you in my case it's fake
i did price transparency and i've cut the price
i do
i don't have a limp
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know about a limp
i don't know how many people here but there's a lot
i don't like it
i don't like it you know you have a democrat governor you have all these democrats watching that stuff
i don't quite get it but you always pick somebody that's hot
i don't think he knows that but the people that manage him know it
i don't think i've ever said this but probably hillary should have picked bernie sanders to be her running mate
i don't think you has a bigger difference and maybe you've never had a bigger difference
i don't want them to be in trouble but they're going to wait till after the election
i don't want to add
i ended last administration's war on american energy
i found him and we hit him good
i gave them everything
i got set up by the beauty parlor owner
i got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor
i got to tell you i was sailing to an easy election
i had 15 incredible american patriots that came by and they said he never said that
i know all about it from the real estate business we brought it all the way down
i know you're really getting up there it's getting very close
i like being energy independent don't you
i like the beauty parlor owner
i look at these crowds and if they're going to cheat crowds are meaningless
i mean it helped that i gave you $28 billion in all fairness right
i mean this stuff is not even really believable but it is what it is
i mean thousands and thousands of people and they're not even affected very little meaning a small percentage of 1%
i never talked about that
i only figured that one out after i became president because i saw what russia was doing and what china was doing
i probably would have not been here tonight
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said couldn't you start it sooner but statutorily that's when it had it start
i said i think they do
i said let us go in
i said somebody else could finish
i said to sonny perdue secretary of agriculture great guy an ex-farmer governor of georgia for eight years great guy
i said we have to do the same thing and if you think that was easy that was not easy
i said you got to do it and the president's been great he's a friend of mine he's doing a very good job
i saved the us auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe the trans-pacific partnership was a disaster
i say why
i swear to you i've changed
i think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade
i think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out and they're only lying if it's us because they don't want to be bothered
i think they do
i think we have bigger crowds potentially
i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's pillaging plundering ransacking and rampant theft of north carolina jobs and us jobs
i used to hate when i'd see all these companies leaving our country going to mexico in particular but canada also a lot of them going to canada and they'd make a product everybody gets fired in our country they close their business and they make the same product in a different country they send it back to us no tax at the border no tariff no nothing
i wanted to go and vote
i was getting calls from democrats and they were saying 
i was getting calls from you won't believe it democrats
i was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here boom boom you put it
i was very lucky though
i went to texas i went to ohio i went to florida it's always like this
i will always stand with american agriculture
i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal as i said and i kept my promise and recognized the true capital of israel and opened the united states embassy in jerusalem
i won by a lot and there was some guy running mcmuffin mcmuffin
i wonder if they did it on purpose what do you think
i worked with senator tim scott of south carolina what a great guy
i would have said 
i wouldn't say that lightly
i'll be honest if this governor that you have i know him
i'll let you know when
i'll say it again if you'd like me to two things if you come back in a thousand years 2000 years or 3000 years
i'll tell you he'll be a great governor
i'll tell you that
i'm going to do this
i'm not kidding you'll be taking them down
i'm saying what
i've actually done more than i promised
i've been doing a lot of it but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible
i've been to many states they're not in shutdowns and they're doing better
i've done more
i've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the african american community and when i'm reelected the best is yet to come
if biden wins china wins
if biden wins the rioters arsonists and anarchists win
if i didn't do that and i took it all from china it was very easy
if i didn't do that i think you wouldn't have any farmers right now
if our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple america they could hardly do better than the biden kamala harris kamala
if that were ever reversed i'm telling you you'd have many people in jail for many many years and it would have started three years ago
if that's the case we have a virtual landslide going
if they come in to our country illegally we supply them with legal advice
if they win it's not going to happen hopefully
if they win the mobs win
if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands more americans would have died
if you are going to church you can't go to church anymore
if you look at that it's over the law abiding areas that we have
if you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market some of the stock markets have already broken every record
if you're lucky enough assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place isn't it
impossible
in fact i got it down to 98%
in fact they have 27000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country
in other words they're not lying about sleepy joe they're lying about us and i don't know if i'm supposed to love that or hate it i don't know if it's an insult or not but i will take it
in the face of china's economic aggression we provided a historic $28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers
in the second term i'll provide school choice to every parent in america
instead of saying he's not talking very nicely about us and we're not going to order any more we're not going to do business no
instead they do the opposite
iran would like them very badly
it doesn't work that way anymore
it should be for many many years to come
it was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers
it was all made up
it was amazing
it was amazing how that stopped
it was so good
it was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it'll happen again
it'll all be solved very quickly
it's a disgrace but let's see what happens
it's a disgrace that it's taken this long
it's a great deal
it's a great honor to be in north carolina
it's a great thing
it's a one-way street with china
it's a very very outstanding senator
it's a wonderful thing
it's all of them
it's amazing
it's america first
it's an incredible thing
it's as simple as that
it's called disinformation
it's clear why both china and the flag burning rioters want biden to win
it's crazy
it's down to 8
it's everything that the border patrol wanted
it's exactly the wall that our great border patrol wanted
it's going to be a beautiful picture going to be a beautiful picture
it's going to be announced by the way just before the election but we're going to have a great third quarter
it's going to get 10 feet higher
it's guts
it's just law and order is that okay
it's like a free fall
it's okay you have to go through a process you have to sign the form you get it
it's only a question of weeks or a small amount of time
it's pretty amazing
it's pretty amazing
it's so sad
it's sort of obvious right
it's too crazy to even talk about but we're never going to give them a chance to do it
it's too long to say obama and biden just call it obiden
it's totally fake
it's wired for every single thing you could have
jim
joe biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters
joe biden and kamala harris rated the most liberal are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric
joe biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs throwing open your borders dragging us into endless foreign wars along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children's future to countries like china
joe biden is weak and will always cave to china who is strong
joe biden who spent 47 years shipping north carolina jobs to china and other countries you know that
joe biden's agenda is made in china my agenda is made in the usa
joe biden's plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide drugs alcohol abuse heart disease and much more
just a terrible thing
just last week sleepy joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police portland district attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters vandals criminals and violent extremists without charge
k they were after him for eight years they never got him i got him
kamala kamala kamala
ladies and gentlemen
later on it was said to be a great move
law and order and safety sir
let me see that one
let us go in
let us go in
let's face it
let's get some of that immune system but they're amazing
let's go
let's see what happens
let's see what happens
let's wait two months maybe we'll get lucky
lieutenant governor dan forest dan
like it
lindsey and tim scott two great ones
lindsey graham everybody lindsey graham
look at 1994 take a look at that
look at general flynn what he's going through for years
look at him
look at that beautiful dress
look at you
look let's have 1000 people
look people get it
look what they're doing in new york what they're doing to our beautiful new york
make sure it counts
make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts
man it's israel as you see and as you've read israel and uae highly respected leader mohammed highly highly respected and now we have other countries in the middle east
maybe i'm wrong who knows
maybe in his case it was real
maybe we'll make a play for that one too
maybe we're going to get lucky and slow joe gets in and we're going to make a great deal
maybe you got to talk to him dan
mcmuffin he was supposed to be second
meanwhile biden he doesn't say a word about the thousands of african-americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in democrat-controlled cities
mexico is going to pay for it
mick it's good to see you
more support than we had four years ago because four years ago i said i was going to do this i was going to cut your taxes i was going to cut regulations i was going to get right to try i was going to take care of your vets i was going to rebuild your military i was going to do all these things and you said 
much more expensive
my heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down
my plan is to arrest them
never happened before
new york
new york the same thing
new york's gone through the roof
next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful americans remember this
no but it was a terrible thing
no he didn't say that did he
no it's terrible she's always preaching about the mask
no no no you don't have to do that
no not too many but they've heard it before
no there'll be in immediately after the election and they'll make a deal we'll make a fair deal with them
no they make this stuff up
no we don't have to bother
no we need law and order
nobody ever heard of that before
nobody knew that when it first came here nobody assumed a thing like that was possible
nobody likes her
nobody should have died not one person
nobody thought that 8
nobody's ever done this before
nobody's ever seen stuff like this
north carolina has to open up
north carolina republican party chairman michael whatley north carolina great
not easy mexico's not easy but he's doing a very good job but the wall is almost completed and it's a tremendous wall
not good sir
now he's starting to say 
now i have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot
now i was told we have 15000 and we're in the middle of an airport someplace
now in the meantime you look at these streets people crazy
now it's going back up
now it's the number one space center in the world by far
now last night though they arrested more than they've ever done because we said you have to
now sometimes you'll ask for a ballot
now that was the thing that was most important to me
now the governor decides we're doing so well that they're going to send out unsolicited
now the new deal under the new deal they get lawyers
now the us marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody
now these crowds i tell you it's beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm beyond what we had four years ago in 2016 and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot
now we did something that nobody thought was possible
now we're doing really well
now we're talking the big stuff
now you got to understand bernie's a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and i got a lot of bernie voters
now you have brand new beautiful f35s we have brand new rockets and missiles
o biden
obama got caught and so did sleepy joe biden

one thing about bernie he's the greatest loser i've ever seen because look any children here
otherwise we're going in
our economy is doing phenomenally well
our farmers are very happy
our jobs numbers were so good
our military was depleted our planes were 50 years old
our teachers are very very important to me
outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors right
over the last three and a half years we've secured america's borders fixed our broken trade deals and they were broken like you've never seen
people don't know that because the fake news doesn't want to write about it
people don't like it when i say that
people don't realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting china
people forget
people love our country so much
people that never really thought in terms of it
people were fighting for that your family lost the farm lost – 53]
perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration
price is going way down january 1st
problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four
proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
really
really
really if they're going to cheat these big beautiful crowds you could have 15000 you could have 50000 these crowds are meaningless
rebuilt the awesome power of the united states military obliterated the isis caliphate 100%
remember a year and a half ago i got it down to 98
remember biden just sitting in the room saying why don't you use the logan act on general flynn
remember kamala
remember that
remember that answer
remember that was a terrible thing
remember the democrats 
remember they said 
remember this very simple to remember

robert thank you very much and thank you all for being here
s
say law and order but with safety
secured american energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world
sending out millions of unsolicited ballots
she could have said 
she could have said 
she could never be
she could never be the first woman president
she faded badly
she finally faded
she said 
she set me up
she started at 15
she was supposed to win
she's meaner probably not as nice
sheriffs in florida ohio texas north carolina
sir $12 billion for the year before and last year sir was 16
sir please don't say law and order
sir we have to be able to see through
sir would you like to take the car
so get your friends and get your family get your neighbors and your coworkers and vote
so he just left but he's been there for 47 years
so i banned it
so i said 
so i'm running for reelection to keep jobs at home to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to america not to china and other countries
so instead of saying 
so it was 52
so many people died
so many people died but if we didn't do it right we would have lost millions of people
so many people went there
so now they know we have it
so on november 3 america faces a very simple choice
so the difference is the following
so we did price transparency kicks in january 1st
so we go to the arenas but because of china the arenas aren't working out too well right
so we had the greatest economy we closed it up and now we're opening it up and your state should go with it
so we have just incredible people in the party
so we're doing these and we're doing the outdoors we're doing the hangars but i really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago
so we're going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest
so we're over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we've ever had by far and it's a good time to have it too
so you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world

that's a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of crooked hillary which was a very nice thing
that's a great group behind me
that's a great thing
that's a solicited ballot
that's courtesy of biden and his friends
that's fine
that's going up in the polls going up
that's good
that's good and tim is another one
that's really bad

that's right
that's something we never talked about
that's the only way as far as the eye can see but they'll correct it
that's the way they do it
that's the way they go
that's too tough
that's what they're talking about
that's what's happening
that's what's happening
that's why he left
that's why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over
that's why the monuments and the statutes they want to knock them down
the biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger
the biden-bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide
the case fatality rates we have the lowest of any major country in the world
the difference is i know how to do something about it they don't
the first thing they do is take away your guts

they think by hurting the economy by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings offices they think by keeping them and hurting them you're hurting the economy
they understand it

they're trying to disparage it they're trying to make it politics
they're trying to do so
they've been destroying suburbs
they've been doing it
think of it
this is a choice
this is a vaccine that we're going to have very soon very very soon by the end of the year but much sooner than that perhaps
this is a very sophisticated group tom
this is all that ideology
this is better than the arenas i have to say especially when you have a crowd like this
this is the american dream and the other i don't want to say it because i'll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there
this is the craziest election
this is the most important election in the history of our country
this is the most important election we've ever had
this is what we need is more lawyers
this state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the world trade organization
this was going to be so easy
this would have taken two or three years by the last administration and in all fairness by most other administrations
thom is going to be a great great senator for another six years we need them both and i hope you're going to do well dan
three months later he said he did the right thing i have to admit
through our historic china virus relief programs we've saved more than 1
to bring hope to our inner cities i created opportunities zones
treasury but nobody's ever done this before
two great ones
two things that will never get obsolete the wall and the wheel right
under my administration we've achieved the most secure border in american history

we got them back we got hostages back from countries that you'd never even heard of and it's been pretty amazing
we got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that
we had great great luck and great people backing us in north carolina
we had the call perfectly and if i didn't have it somehow with these people i guess i'd still be here if you want to know the truth but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing the republicans stuck together and kevin mccarthy's done a fantastic job
we had to close it up
we had to open it and start all over again
we have a lot of big shots over there i see but what do you think about a guy named mark meadows chief of staff
we have a lot of military people here

what's this all about
when i banned travel from china biden called it hysterical and xenophobic
when i took over our military was depleted

you can't get any worse than her when you think
you can't go to church
you can't go to church you can't do anything
you couldn't build a road
you don't have a thing to worry about
you don't have that anymore
you don't know what the hell you're doing
you don't know what you're doing
you ever see the statistics on young people
you got me
you got to wear the mask at all times indoor outdoor
you have solicited and unsolicited
you have to look at the d
you have to stay in your house but if you're willing to riot running down main street if you're willing to riot and stand on top of each other's face and do whatever the hell you want to do you're allowed to do that because you're considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests even my people my very brilliant consultants who i don't listen to too much maybe i should
you just had the best year
you just had the best year of the history of your state last year
you know that
you know the money that your state is going to be losing
you know the rule the regulation that i just terminated
you know there was a poll that just came out i think it was gallup and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying
you know they'd look at it
you know we had to take our convention away he said you're allowed to have 10 people in the arena 10 because it said one room 10 you're not supposed to have political rallies
you know what
you know what
you know what i'm talking about
you know what i'm talking about patriotic education
you know what it means they want to take away your history
you know what people don't like her
you know when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago i signed a very strong executive order
you may get rejected for a highway or for a road but you're going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months
you remember she left the race
you remember that evening
you said 
you saw that
you saw that at the convention what al-baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter and incredible how our troops handled that
you see these guys they go around saying yeah i want your meal
you see what's going on
you see what's happened
you should see it it was incredible
you study it
you want to knock them down
you wouldn't believe
you'd pass away and your kids would get the farm they'd go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive
you'll be taking your monuments down
you'll be taking your statues down
you'll see it
you're in a shutdown
you're just bringing people in and we don't want to do that
you're not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand
you've seen that
your state should be open
197 and nothing
5 trillion worth of new beautiful jets and equipment and rockets and everything
7 billion and poured 180000 cubic yards that's a lot of concrete to build 108 miles of powerful border wall
91% approval rate
a few friends of mine who are warriors
a friend of mine and somebody who's a great fighter pilot and i had a lot of people tell me she could really wheel the warthog right
a lot of friends you have
a month later pelosi and all these people said 
a woman who really distinguished herself she became a star
about time
also a great friend of all of ours former state treasurer of arizona jeff dewitt
also thanks to arizona republican party chairman i knew this was going to happen
also the crime was incredible what happened
anchor babies
anchor babies you know that right
and a man who didn't choke under pressure
and as soon as we want all of a sudden they never talk about it
and by the way i thought they learned that lesson a little while ago
and by the way ice ice is great
and by the way mark morgan where's the great mark morgan
and considering that we caught president obama and sleepy joe biden spying on our campaign treason will probably be entitled to another four more years after that
and give every illegal alien on the planet earth a free ticket to invent an asylum claim and gain automatic admission into our country
and he loves our vets and he loves our military and you love our second amendment right
and i hear we're going to win it by even more this time
and i mean murders and i mean rapist i mean really bad people and they don't get in and they don't get back
and i said 
and i said something very simple
and i think you're more popular today
and i want to congratulate your governor because we had a spike and he knocked that spike out so fast
and i want to thank you very much
and i will tell you i never thought i'd say it because we had a great election
and i'm proud to say that they've achieved the most secure border our border patrol in the history of the united states of america
and if they don't stand for our flag if they don't stand for our national anthem i turn off the game
and if we keep going at the rate it'll be about 85% in about two months
and if you held on like i said to do we went down a little while we got hit with a virus
and nobody said that was possible because i couldn't have gotten it through the democrats because they don't like that
and nobody understands the border better than hispanics
and our numbers are the best
and right now who has the 401k
and she's running against a gentlemen who is when you read what he's done when you read what he said about the second amendment and about all other things you're not going to want to vote for
and specifically she said 
and that's been helped because we're at a little bit over 280 miles right now we have never been helped like this
and that's the only thing you'll recognize
and then the rest of you many of you have stocks and you do it a different way
and then you listen to michelle obama's speech which was obsolete by the time it got there
and they are great friends of mine
and they say 
and they want to spend much less on our military we've totally rebuilt
and they wouldn't take
and they wouldn't take him under the obama administration
and they're spending so much
and today i salute each and every one of those true american heroes and that's what they are
and we have a man named andy biggs here
and we have our great governor
and we have to make sure that this radical left socialist and beyond because this is beyond socialism that it doesn't happen or we will indeed have venezuela on steroids
and we want people that are going to come in and are going to love for our country not hate our country
and we want people to come in but we want them to come in through merit right
and we'll just decouple thank you very much
and we're building the wall
and we're giving the rebate that creates tremendous wealth for the middle man the rebate
and we're giving you the tools to do the job that you signed up for
and we're not going to do anything with it
and we've reduced illegal border crossings by 60% since this time last year
and what we've done did you ever notice the caravans
and you know what
and you see it all the time
another friend of mine and incredible fighter and somebody that loves his state and i'll tell you the freedom caucus right
another with normal brain power they'd say 
anytime you see an ad from a drug company and they're rich the farmer it's called big farmer the number one lobbyist
anytime you see anytime at all you see an ad by big farmer against me you know your drug prices are coming down
appreciate
are we winning
are you sure you even had a spike
arizona thank you very much
as you know better than anyone the survival of our nation is at stake in this election
at last night's democrat convention which by the way got very bad ratings i have to tell you
be careful with your ballots but get out there
be very careful
because it is hot in here
because joe he doesn't know where he is
because they don't want bad things to happen that's why
because they know i'm angry because they know i don't care so much anymore
because they know it's bad politics because they know having a wall they can't win that one
before they weren't taking them back at all
bernie sanders declared in his speech many of the ideas that just a few years ago were considered radical are now mainstream
biden opposed the ban
biden's campaign has turned into a cult for open border and others zealots
biden's plan is the most radical extreme reckless dangerous and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate
big trouble
but i don't think that goes
but if biden wins it will be a giant jail break for ms-13 and vicious criminal gangs
but if he did he's been brought so far left that our country will not be the country that we know
but it shows you how smart they are doug
but martha mcsally is an extraordinary person and she's fighting for us and she's helping us and we have to bring her into the center
but more important than these numbers is the fact that we've ended catch and release
but one of the opening speakers last night said that america will go to hell if we don't have open borders
but she was a great great fighter pilot one of the best they were telling me
but that last hope that biden will win they will own our country china they will own our country
but the only thing is i'll bet you this man would stand only stand for our national anthem
but they don't stop they keep calling it they say i built the cages
but they go the opposite
but we have it
but you are going to get 50
but you know where i talk about it
by the way they want to double and triple your taxes they want to increase regulations they want to spend very little money on our vets after we took care of our vets better than anyone's
by the way you talk about guns
can you believe it
can you believe that
china wants him to win so badly
come back in four years you have a trial
companies are moving in like nobody has seen before
compare our achievements with the insane and lethal policies that biden and bernie sanders want
congratulations
could you extend that plane
crazy bernie
debbie there are no more caravans
don't forget last time i talked i said we're going to give you a tax cuts i gave you
don't land your plane
doug and i were talking about it and they take out registered voters
doug ducey a great governor great man and a somebody that won by about 16 or 17 points
drugs
end prosecution of illegal border crosses ensuring that illegal aliens will repeatedly reenter the country over and over again and terminate all protections we have enacted against asylum fraud
everybody came together
everybody fought us the democrats everyone
everyone said 
following orders from his boss
for decades washington politicians like biden allowed an endless supply of illegal foreign labor to decimate american jobs and wages
for the first time ever the united states is now exercising our full legal authority to expedited removal
four years ago i never thought i'd say anything could compete with 2016
free all illegal aliens from federal detention and close detention facilities this would make removing illegal aliens totally impossible and you would have murderers killers rapists in your midst
getting off the border getting off illegal protection all of that we are going to lower your taxes further
give you your tax cuts i gave them to you
go out and win
go out and work like hell
go to hell
governor can we make it a little bit just a little
governor thank you
great job debbie
great job you're doing
great job you're doing
half of all border patrol agents are hispanic americans i was just with them
have a baby in our country and you stay for the rest of your life
he didn't build it we built that for the obama administration
he had no idea what the hell he was doing
he kicked for 11 years
he never choked
he said 
he's a fighter
he's a fighter
he's around here someplace
he's here someplace
he's one of the best kickers ever
here in yuma arizona we've invested over $1
here's just a short list of our landmarks
hispanic americans are the people that are most in favor of what we're doing on the border because they understand it
hopefully we never have to use it
how about her
i always assume it's going to be close
i bring people together
i can't believe how many there are
i didn't build them
i don't even know if he's here
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know though i think i'm going to win yuma
i don't think it's so bad at all
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think you'd have
i entered into a historic partnership with mexico known as the migrant protection protocols to safely return asylum seekers to mexico while awaiting hearings in the united states
i entered into three landmark agreements with honduras and el salvador and guatemala to end the abuse of the asylum system
i fought the special interests
i guess his new boss is bernie sanders
i guess technically they're right we lost when it didn't matter
i had a lot of people a lot of good politicians go 
i have a lot of people in that industry do not like me too much
i implemented a historic public charge regulation to finally and fully enforce the federal requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient they cannot accept welfare for at least five years
i just created favorite nation
i just want to say stay healthy stay sharp be careful
i kept every single promise that i made and now i'm doing it with the drug companies
i knew that she was going
i know who's going to vote for me
i love that plane
i oppose the ban
i remember the 61 yarder
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said 
i said we're going to give you a massive regulation cuts
i said we're going to give you massive regulation cuts we're going to give you great everything
i stood up to the lobbyists
i swiftly implemented a travel ban on china and i was criticized
i think he might be here
i think we are
i think when i hear those numbers when we hear those numbers we're winning
i thought they learned that lesson two years ago but maybe not but they will
i told you already our military is the best it's ever been
i wanted to thank you and art and brandon you're incredible
i went 
i won it last time by a lot
i wonder why you're saying that but we did it
i'll tell you what
i'm not a divider
i'm speaking next thursday maybe i'll tape it
i'm the only candidate that gave you more than i promised in the campaign
i'm the only one ever maybe ever
i'm very happy
i've known you now a long time
ice has taken out thousands and thousands of ms-13 and you don't want the job
if i weren't president i don't believe doug you'd have a second amendment right now
if we don't win they can put it back and with the things that we did put in which are many many many things many things our military our vets everything with all of the things that we put in it's like a tree it takes a little while to grab on
if we don't win this country is in big trouble
if we had listened to sleepy joe biden hundreds of thousands of additional american lives would have been lost
if we have four more years there's nothing that they can do
if you come back in a thousand years you'll say 
immediately suspend all removals triggering a tidal wave of really a flood if you think a flood all across our border
in january after the china virus after the outbreak after the outbreak the china virus outbreak it came from wuhan right
in the biden bernie manifesto joe biden promises to restore and expand catch and release across the entire us border
in total i've already completely planned for the final execution we're going to have by the end of the year everything that we said is going to be built
iran wants him to win so badly
is she
is she a great one
it just is a winner
it must be defeated and it will be defeated on november 3rd
it never breaks down
it took a lot of guts to do it
it was obsolete
it will be defeated
it will have problems it will go down
it's 122 degrees in this place
it's a tough job but they like it and they're great patriots and they've done a fantastic job
it's amazing how that works doug

it's going to the people now
it's got $2
it's got to grab on
it's not happening anymore
it's not registered
it's the fake news
it's true
jay
joe biden has pledged to abolish immigration enforcement suspend all removals provide free government healthcare and they want to give it to illegal aliens
joe biden is the puppet of the radical left wing movement that seeks the complete elimination of america's borders and boundaries
just remember i said it but you're not going to have to worry about it because it's not going to happen
kelly thank you
kelly ward

nfl kicker jay feely

nobody told me it was going to be this hard
none of you want the job
november 3rd is the biggest date one of the biggest dates in your life in many cases frankly it's the most important date of your life
now nasdaq just broke an all time record
now this is all simple and i really respect because so far i've only seen about four or five people go down
now you see it and you see what's going up and it's an incredible structure all capable all wired up for cameras for everything you can have
numbers
oh no let people come in
oh thank you very much everybody
oh that's so bad
oh that's so bad
okay good
on november 3rd
one half a brain
one other thing we've done lot
or we'll head to the polls and together we'll stop the left and win four more years in the white house
other than mitt romney one half a vote

our country is sailing
our country is sailing
our nuclear arsenal and hopefully hopefully we never have to even look at it our nuclear arsenal is at a level that it's never ever been before and we have to have it there but we never want to use it
over the last three years border patrol and ice have seized over two million pounds of fentanyl heroin meth and other deadly narcotics
over the last three years ice officers have made over 380000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of over 145000 assaults 40000 sex crimes and 5 800 murders
paul
paul gosar
paul gosar
paul stand up
please don't do anything
really they are landmarks true landmarks
remember i said we will never have a socialist country
remember when they said 
restore catching and release
right
right
right
right fellas
right now mexico has 27000 of their soldiers on our southern border helping us to guard our southern border
see we won
she became a star overnight
she is not the right pick but she was my number one draft pick
she must have taped it about three weeks before
she never gives up
she never stops
she said 
she taped it
she wants no 2nd amendment
she wants to raise your taxes to a level you'll be paying your government back for a long time
shield violent criminal aliens
sir i don't think you should do it
snp just broke an all time record
so by the end of our of not my our first term we will have appointed 300 federal judges and appeals court judges and two supreme court justices
so i'm thrilled to be in yuma arizona to proudly accept the endorsement of the national border patrol council that's a big deal
so if a nation buys it for less and they buy it for a fraction of what we pay the drug companies have to sell it to us for the same price
so it's a great honor
so now they don't come into the united states they can wait outside
so they just say 
so they said we lost
so they're very smart
so we actually may put up some additional but we will have it completed everything we said by the end of the year and nobody thought that was possible
so we can't do it
so we got stuck with them because they'd fly in
so we have done things not only on the border the border is one element and to me it's very important
so we have people coming in to this country some great people some really bad people too
so we take them back by the thousands by the thousands
so we're doing that
so yuma thank you very much
socialism is the mainstream of the biden campaign and it's not the mainstream of america
something that they always say about a president the most important thing a president can do is the appointment of federal judges and supreme court justices
success was bringing everyone together and then we got hit with the china virus but we were bringing people together
technology is incredible
thank you
thank you
thank you everybody
thank you for all your support
thank you jeff
thank you kelly
thank you martha
thank you paul
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you very much doug
that includes the millions of incredible hispanic americans who follow our laws uplift our community and protect our nation in uniform
that was a heartbreaker
that was built by obama
that was in january i imposed it very early
that will go down 50 60 70% 80%
that's bernie sanders
that's called fake news fake news
that's good
that's never happened before
that's not so bad
that's okay
that's one thing
that's one thing i can tell you
that's pretty good
that's so much nicer to tape it you do it nice air conditioned room
that's the best plane
that's what it is
that's what most likely registered they're dead they're old they're not going to go they're not going to do anything
that's what they say
that's what we've done
the biden plan would unleash a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen
the biden-harris plan is a step by step recipe for abolishing america's borders
the caravans don't come up
the cruel and heartless portrayal of the american people ended the day i took the oath of office and now that we have more than half of the wall built and do you notice they don't talk about the wall anymore
the fake news said we didn't because we lost in the lower court we lost in the second court and we won in the supreme court
the historic achievements that i've discussed today are only a slim fraction of the extraordinary accomplishment that we've all done together in the last four years
the last administration simply released these criminals
the national border patrol council is the official union representing the incredible heroes of the united states border patrol
the next president i think will pick two three or even four justices of the supreme court
the numbers are so good
the numbers are so low
the people of arizona our great state we love arizona
the pressure that was put on to get rid of it or to basically obliterate it make it so it's meaningless
the republicans came
the warthog
then i imposed it in europe also heavily infected with italy and france and spain
then they did it again
then you bring in your family
there was a headline in time magazine about the cage and somebody called in that built it
there was nobody better than debbie lesko
there was nobody smarter
there was nobody tougher
there's some tough people here
these are warriors
these great men and women catch somebody maybe a murderer maybe a rapist maybe a trafficker they catch somebody take his name take his number and they release them into our country
they all take them back now
they allowed criminal gangs to menace maim and terrorize innocent citizens
they are not happy
they asked me that
they buy so much good record numbers soybeans record numbers
they came in
they can be on the court for 40 to 50 years
they can't take it back
they ceded control of the border to the most dangerous and ruthless cartels on earth
they choke choke choke
they could be on there for 40 to 50 years
they don't come up anymore
they don't talk
they don't talk about the wall anymore
they don't want bad people coming into our country taking their jobs taking their homes causing crime
they don't want to talk about it
they have ceded
they have these suppression the fakers back there they have the suppression polls where they interview many more democrats than they do republicans
they know what's good what's bad
they let lethal poisonous drugs pour freely into our schools and our communities but no more
they lost
they miss a three footer
they miss a three footer
they overstay for years
they really are
they said 
they said 
they said we lost debbie because we lost the first two but we won in the supreme court so they said 
they say 
they say 
they spend millions and millions hundreds of millions of dollars online
they talk about unity
they thought i was happy
they thought i was happy for him
they told me to say that
they understand it better than anybody
they want to bring unity
they want to do things that nobody thought was even possible to contemplate
they want to have a sanctuary city not going to be like the old days
they want to take the wall down they don't want to have borders they want to have sanctuary cities lots of bad things they want
they were built in 2014
they will destroy that second amendment
they would in a million years they wouldn't do it
they would maim and terrorize and we have done something with our border patrol
they'd say 
they'll learn it again
they'll say 
they're not happy
they're spending millions of dollars on advertising
they're very very smart but we can never forget what china did to this country and did to the world
they've been my friends from the beginning
think of that
think of that one
think of yourself at a great spa great sauna where it's 120 degrees and we have to pay a lot of money to be there
this election that we're going into is the most important election in the history of our country because we had crooked hillary but this is something these people are sick
this guy lasted 11 years
this is going to be the most consequential presidency
this is going to be the most important and i never thought i'd say it because of what happened four years ago this is going to be the most important election of your life
this is like a test
this is what they want to do
this is what would happen
this time it'll go even faster
this was a group and they knew a very well
this was like a life and death war
those cages were built in 2014 by obama
to every border agent and i just met some unbelievable people backstage these are great people and every family member here today you have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation
to me that's number one
to protect our country and our agents during the pandemic my administration took immediate action to ensure the safe and rapid return of all illegal aliens
to protect us workers i suspended the entry of low wage workers that threatened all of your jobs american jobs and we're finalizing the new h-1b regulations to permanently end the displacement of us workers
today a democrat speaker at the convention said 
two and a half trillion dollars we've totally rebuilt our military
under the obama biden i call it obiden under the obiden administration our agents were ordered to ignore the law and release illegal aliens by the hundreds of thousands
under the trump administration if you cross our border illegally you are quickly apprehended and swiftly returned back home
unity
vote mcsally
wall there are two things in a thousand years you can come back two things will never with technology it's obsolete before you even put it in the box but two things never get old wheels and walls
we are proudly defending the job safety and security of the american people which is what i promised to do
we are very tough at the border
we better win
we bring them out
we brought them back
we brought them back can you believe it
we can't
we canceled the lawless policies of the previous administration and empowered border agents and ice officers to do their jobs and proudly enforce the laws of the united states of america
we cut down that payment that i was talking about substantially and they're still very happy and they are working with us very well and that includes mexico
we decreased your taxes more than anybody has ever done and we're doing more because that's going to spell growth and that's what happened
we did a good thing
we did a thing called the space force
we did things that i didn't even talk about it we did
we don't have to do that
we don't have to go through years and years of litigation
we don't want them
we ended the obama biden policy of giving work permits to newly arriving illegal aliens
we established the national vetting center the most advanced visa screening system anywhere in the world
we even did right to try medicine
we got sued all over the place that we won
we got the wall
we got to have her on our side
we had a great election a little while ago
we had to have them in the united states and we captured them we had to keep him here
we have a great travel ban now for countries that are not countries where we want the people coming in
we have many countries beyond the four that i mentioned the three plus one many countries
we have very few in our country now
we imposed it because china was heavily infected
we instituted a national security travel ban on the world's most dangerous regions including jihadist regions keeping terrorists and extremists out of our country
we issued regulations to stop the horrible practice of birth tourism
we issued strict sanctions on countries that failed to take back their own criminals
we just got rid of it
we know so much about the people coming in
we know the good and we know the bad
we love you
we made a great trade deal but i don't care
we made such a great deal
we may actually build some more in some soft areas that we've noticed over the last two years
we need every single vote that we can get because it's probably going to be close
we never built the cages
we never the cages they were built by obama and the fake news is constantly saying that i built cages for children
we now have the most secure border we've ever had and it's only going to get better
we removed 20000 gang members including 4500 ms-13
we stopped payment
we stopped payment
we stopped payment and they called
we stripped federal grant funding from deadly sanctuary cities
we take them out
we want her on our side
we want them outside
we were bringing people together
we were bringing people together like never before
we will have people coming into our country that never even thought of it before
we will never ever let you down
we will never let you down
we won the travel ban
we'd be honored to take them
we'd love to take them
we're bringing the rebate and it's going to the people
we're going to have drug prices reduced over a very short period of time by not 2% and last year they went down a little bit first time in 51 years that drug prices went down but a little bit we're going to have prices dropping 50 60 and even 70%
we're going to win yuma big
we're joined today by some incredible people friends of mine great great people
we're making sure they go home and we're making sure they stay home
we're not going to pay you anymore
we're talking about abolishing the police we're talking about abolishing ice we're talking about abolishing prisons
we've cut regulations more than any president in the history of our country whether it's four years eight years or in one case more
we've gotten rid of a lot of nonsense from obama like the paris accord that costs us tens of billions of dollars and gave us nothing
we've gotten rid of so many different things that you have no idea but you know what
we've made historic progress to crack down on visa overstays
we've never had numbers like this because that big portion of wall already built you don't get through it
we've suspended refugee
we've suspended refugee resettlements from the world's most dangerous regions because nothing is more important than keeping america safe
well five years later you catch them
well i'm not going to buy any more corn
well kickers are the same
well thank you very much
well we still have wheels in walls
well why are we doing that
what a job you've done
what do you think doug
what happened
what happened
what happened
what happened to the caravans
what were we
wheels and wall
when a country doesn't have borders you don't have a country
when i have every farmer in the country calling and saying 
when it comes to 2nd amendment when it comes to life when it comes to a lot of things that you people live for if you don't have the supreme court and if you don't have the courts in your side you can forget it
when people want to come in for our farmers et cetera et cetera we're not going to hurt our farmers but we've never had better numbers than we have right now
when they went and they tried to make a play at your president they had to get through the house
when we bring them back to their country could be mexico also they don't come back
when we caught a murderer and we wanted to bring it back to one of those countries they wouldn't take him
when we win i'll have a deal with the red within a month watch because they're dying to make a deal
where is he
where is jay
